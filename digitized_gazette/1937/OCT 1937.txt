The Autumn meeting of the Sarawak Turf Club took place on September 2nd. 4th and 6th, and provided three days very enjoyable sport. A full account of the meeting will lie found elsewhere in this issue. On September 13th twenty-eight Malays left Kuching by the Vyner Brooke to go on the Haj, among them Tua Kampong Moham¬ med Arbi and Dayang Siti. Dayang Siti, who is the widow of the late Datu Temong- gong, is over eighty years old. We welcome back Mr. and Mrs. T. Corson and Mr. R. N. Baron, who returned from furlough on Septmber 13th and 10th respec¬ tively. Mr. Corson has resumed duty as Senior Forest Officer, and Mr. Baron has gone in Simanggang. Mr. B J. C Spurway, who was acting as Senior Forest Officer during Mr Corson's absence, sailed on furlough on September 18th. Others to sail for home on leave din ing the month were Mr. H. M. Calvert, Financial Secretary, and Mrs. Calvert, and Mr. E. Banks. Talking of furlough, the Borneo Company, Ltd., who are agents for the East Asiatic Company’s steamers, inform us that special terms will be extended to Government officers who book return passages by these steamers. A strange phenomenon was observed in Kuching on September 16th. From about 9.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. the sun, which was shining brightly, was surrounded by a dark circular halo edged with a rainbow. The day was fine and clear, and the effect was strange in the extreme since the halo, which covered an extensive portion of the sky, was almost black. The local Malays say that the phenomenon denotes the death of some great man, but so far no news has been received of the death of any celebrity. We have just received a remarkable proof of the influence on modern life and thought of the Sarawak Gazette. In a film critique written some months ago we commended the Marx brothers to the Surrealists; it now appears that this advice has been taken to heart, since we hear that Salvador Dali, the movement’s foremost painter (if one excludes Picasso) has painted a picture of Harpo Marx surrounded by an aura of flaming giraffes. Obituary. ABANG HAJI MOASILI BIN ABANG HAJI ABDULRAHMAN. We deeply regret to record the death, which took place at the General Hospital, Kuching, on September 13th, 1937, of Abang Haji Moasili bin Abang Haji Abdulrahman. Datu Hakim of Sarawak. The late Datu Hakim joined the Service on August 1st, 1912. although previously to this he had (served for seven years as Registrar of Mohammedan Marriages. He was appointed Native Officer. Lim- bang, where he served continuously until 1931, when he was transferred to Kuching; he became a member of the Council Negri in 1915. and was promoted to the rank of Datu in 1931. On his transfer to Kuching he was appointed Datu Hakim, a post which had formerly been held by his father. He was gazetted a member of the Supreme Council on August 1st. 1931. and received his Long Service Decoration in the following month. The Datu was a man of great strength nf character and personal charm, and was liked and respected by all who came in contact with him. He fulfilled the duties of his office with conspicuous success, and by his death His Highness the Rajah loses a valuable servant, and the Malay community an honoured representative. The funeral, which took place on September 14th, was attended by a large number of mourners of all races. We extend our deepest sympathy to the Datu's relatives. CAPTAIN W. T. CLARK. We deeply regret to announce the death, which took place in London on September 29th, of Captain W. T. Clark, late of the Sarawak Rangers. Captain Clark joined the Sarawak Rangers on March 1st, 1912. as Instructor, was promoted Lieutenant on September 1st, 1915, and Captain on September 1st, 1923. Except for a period of seven months in Miri as Officer Commanding Sarawak Rangers and Police there, all his service was spent in Kuching, where he acted as Com¬ mandant on various occasions. Captain Clark served on several expeditions and was awarded the Sarawak Military Long Service Medal in 1929. Before coming to Sarawak Captain Clark served for twenty-one years with the Royal Marine Light Infantry, and had the Long Service Medal. Captain Clark had. therefore served under one Queen, two Kings and' two Rajahs, and earned two Long Service Medals and two pensions,—surely something of a record. He was very popular in Kuching, where he was always to the fore in dub and social life, and he became quite a tradition in the Rangers, where he managed to win the con¬ fidence and affection of the rank and file to a quite exceptional degree. We extend our deepest sympathy to his widow and children in their great loss. MR. E. H. P. BENGTSSON. We deeply regret to learn that Mr. E. H. P. Bengtsson died suddenly in England on August 10th. Mr. Bengtsson brought H.H.M.Y Maimuna out from England in 1926, and joined the Government Service first as Chief Engineer of this vessel, and then as Superintendent Engineer, Government Workshop, in which post he served until his retire¬ ment in July. 1932. Mr. Bengtsson, who had an adventurous life, was a Yorkshireman of the best type, shrewd. kindly and with a great sense of humour, indeed many of his sayings being still current in Sarawak. We are sure that Mr. Bengtsson’s many, friends in this country will join with us in expressing our deepest sympathy to his widow and daughter. Shabby Pilgrimage. Very little will be done to improve the relation¬ ship between Islam and Christendom by the publication of Triumphant Pilgrimage (Harrap, His. 6.), an account by Owen Rutter of an English Moslem's trip to Mecca. Trip is the right word. "David Chale," whose incredibly aquiline profile serves as frontispiece, was a young district officer in Borneo and developed a great liking for the Malays, which raised confused ideas in his mind of "giving them a lead" and in some obscure way promoting world peace by adopting their religion, a resolve bolstered up by a good deal of oblique disparagement of the Sarawak administration. According to Mr. Rutter he then returned to London and spent some years as a financier, amassing enough money to enable him to make the immemorial pilgrimage in company with a Malay wife of wondrous charm and surpassing manners. Mr. Chale" found a good many obstructions placed in the way of his venture, mostly by Moslem officials who unworthily suspected that he lacked sincerity, and seemed to think that he might actually want to write a book about his experiences. This suspicion appears to shock Mr. Rutter pro¬ foundly. to judge by his castigation of other so-called pilgrims who have written up their journey. However, by a shabby, and disingenuous piece of sophistry and—so we were given to under¬ stand—by practically hypnotising the Emir Feisal, "Chale” slipped through the official barriers and offers as the result a decidedly second-rate tourist’s account of the activities at Mecca when the pilgrims arrive. Friend "Chale” seems fairly pleased with himself, to judge by the mood in which his biographer writes, in which he appears to recount his own adventures with bated breath and wondering eye, and by the manner in which the merely difficult is placed before the reader in the guise of the strenuously dangerous. Triumphant Pilgrimage will make Moslems suspect the good faith of con verts more than ever, and is a particularly blatant example of the lengths to which some sensation-hunters will go to get the "inside story.” —(Truth.) India Association of Sarawak. INAUGURAL LUNCHEON. On Sunday, September 19th, the members of the Indian Association of Sarawak gave a luncheon to mark the Association’s inauguration. The Associa¬ tion, which was registered on September 1st. 1937. lias the following objects :— (a) To cultivate friendly feelings among Indians in Sarawak. (b) To render any possible assistance to the poor and the needy members of the Community. (c) To establish among the Indians an organisa¬ tion which may eventually become an efficients representative body to express the opinion of the Community as a whole on questions affecting their general welfare, and also to be of use on any occasion requiring public co-operation. At the end of a. most enjoyable meal the following speech was made by Dr. K. V. Krishna, the President of the Association :— “GENTLEMEN, “We are now here under the auspicies of the Indian Association of Sarawak. Its members are very happy because they have been able to organise themselves into a united body and to get their Association registered to function in this place. “As the first object of their Association is to bring about friendly feelings among all the Indians living in Sarawak, irrespective of denominational differences either of race or religion, they wanted to give a practical expression to this by arranging the function of this afternoon. They wanted others also to participate in their joy; so they extended their invitations to non-members of their own nationality and also to some gentlemen of other nationalities. "As the President of this Association I thank you all very much, on my behalf and on behalf of its Committee and Members, for your kindness in honouring us by your presence here even with such a short notice as you have had. At the same time I thank the members of this Association publicly for electing me their first President. Though I do not claim to have any special qualifications to hold this position. I think I must have been chosen being the one that resided here longest out of the present English-speaking Indians. “It is nothing unusual to form an Association or to get it registered. Therefore, some of you may think why the members of this infant Association of a Community that is neither large, rich, nor influential should be so jubilant as this over this matter. There is a reason, gentlemen! I came to reside in this place in the latter part of 1922. after having lived in the interior for some time. A few months later, two Indian gentlemen came and asked me if I would represent the Indians on the Knelling Municipal and Sanitary Advisory Board it looked to me strange that the election should be done in this way. I was not sure that all the other Indians would like me to be elected. However, when I learnt there were only three religious organizations here, one each for the Hindus. Mohammadans and Sikhs, and that it was customary to elect in this way, I agreed to their wish and did what I could while on the Board. Having had an opportunity to study the local Indians at close quarters I found certain things : "1. The Indians that came first to this place in large numbers were labourers, and their ways and manners did not help to give any good opinion about the rest of the Indians as a class to the local people who never had occasion to see a better class of Indians. “2. Those that had settled down in this place began to deteriorate and did not follow the advances in social improvement that were taking place in their homeland. “3 Education among their children was neglec¬ ted and, even as a backward class, they had no encouragement from any source. “4. Indians did not take an active part in public entertainments but were only mere spectators. "With the object of gradually improving all these, I railed in Several of the Indians and dis¬ cussed with them the desirability of having an Association for all Indians The Chief Secretary, whom I went to see, had no objection to our having an Association when he had learnt our views. However, the Indians thought that the time was not yet come for them to have an Association, but that they would meet when any occasion arose and also that they would present a cup in the name of the Community during the races or at the regatta. “After some time, I approached the late lamented Chief Secretary, Major Moulton, and discussed with him some method by which the ways of the Indian labourers may be improved, especially their ways on the road-side when under the influence of drink'. He encouraged me. if I had the lime. Io see them in their 'lines’ and use persuasive methods for reform. Whenever possible I did so alone or along with Mrs. Krishna, gave them advice, gramo¬ phone entertainments, and arranged at times for free Cinema shows for all the Indians and took the opportunity to exhort them to live in a manner respectable to themselves and to their country. Whatever might have been the cause, we do not, now-a-days see on the road-side such scenes, not; are they given a night's rest in the, Police Station. “Seeing that the labourers bad no idea about thrift. I encouraged several of them to deposit a dollar a month in the Post Office Savings bank and they did so for a time. “There were some labourers without work who were not complete decrepits but were not strong enough to do a full day's labour. When I spoke to Captain Lowe, the Director of the P.W.I). lie was pleased to find them some suitable work, and the Indian labourers think of this kind-hearted gentleman with gratitude. "After me came some Indians, either to do their own business or in the employ of the Government or private firms. They found they had no comment place to meet and to put in their share of work for the Community. On one or two occasions some of them talked this matter over with me. but 1 said that I had done my share of work and it was for them to do what they wanted. “Some time ago certain events happened that made these Indians feel more acutely the need for a Common Association. “1. ' They heard that a certain member had been elected and his name had been sent up as a candi¬ date for the Visiting Board. Many of the Indians were sorry for the selection, and they were happy when the proposal was ignored and the represen¬ tative was not accepted. 2. When H.E. the Governor of Singapore visited this place the Indians as a class did nothing to show that they were living here. “3. Another thing affected the whole State recently. His Highness the Rajah lost his mother. the late Ranee Margaret. No letter of condolence was sent to His Highness from the Indian Com¬ munity and many of ns were very sorry for tins unfortunate omission. "While we were contemplating over these, as if by a happy coincidence, the Registrar of Societies called in a few of the Indians and suggested to them that the formation of an Association for the Indians would be desirable and would add to the dignity of the Indian Community if any visitors came. "No time was lost. The Association is formed. Now, gentlemen, you see why we are happy. I am particularly happy that my dream of several years has come to a realization. "Though some of the results obtained by my efforts were allowed to disappear when 1 was away on a long holiday, I have been anxious that all of them should not meet with the same fate. There¬ fore I now feel happy; for, the Association can look after such things. We have now Indians of seven classes as members, differing either in race, language or religion. It is our hope that more members will join to make this Association a com¬ plete success. "Another reason why we are happy is this. hospitality of the different Communities of this piace. we never had the honour of inviting you all in the name of the Indian Community. It is come now. It was even my desire that a bigger party should meet here than we now see, but our mem- bers thought that it is best to be modest in the beginning. "I am very thankful to you all for having come to this occasion. Owing to our giving a short notice, several more of the distinguished gentlemen of this place could not attend this function and we regret very much. However, many, of them were kind enough to send their good wishes for our success. Now I present this infant Associa- tion to you and invoke your blessing. I also hope die the members will work for the benefit of the Association. His Highness the Rajah once wrote a letter saying as peaceful, law-abiding citizens, we have always regarded the members of the Indian Com¬ munity with friendly feelings,’ and our one object will be to continue to deserve this compliment. “As we are living happily in this peaceful State of Sarawak. gentlemen. I propose the health of Their Highnesses the Rajah and the Ranee.” This was followed by a speech by Mr. S. C. S. Chakraverty. who spoke as below' :— "The need for an Association open to fill Indians in Sarawak, its usefulness, the difficulties and delay in its formation, the the untiring zeal of its members to attain their long cherised desire have been well described by our beloved President. Dr. K. V. Krishna, whose patience, determination and sacri¬ fice have been far above the average level and deserve admiration and applause. "Tin enjoyment and pleasure we are having here tody is greatly due to the encouragement of our President as well as to the brotherly co-operation of the Committee and the Members of our Association. "It is also a fact that our party would not have been so lively nor our joy so exuberant had we not been lucky enough to have in our midst such a good number of distinguished Europeans and Asiatics as our guests whose presence has played a major part in bringing today's function to a success. "In this happy mood I take the liberty to offer my heartfelt thanks to you all for the trouble you have taken to grace this occasion and also for your kind interest and noble wishes towards our infant Association. “The combination of Divine grace, the ideal atmospheric conditions, the sweet silent content¬ ment and unshakable joy of our members reminds me of the immortal lines "Society. Friendship and love divinely bestowed upon man ..." and I am so proud that our Association pays no less a homage to these lines by being a concrete illustration of the ideal conveyed in them. "We, a handful of Indians, far away from home, having so many noble persons in our midst, are enjoying the benefit of assembling in a place, exchanging our thoughts and ideas by friendly talk, and, in course of time, we all may be dispersed to the different pairs of the Globe by the call of duty, but the sweet memory of today's function will ever remain green in us and will give us all a chance, in tranquil moments, to live again our happy recollections in later days. "Gentlemen. I thank you all again and again for making us so happy and I wish you all Health and Happiness " Mr. H. M. Calvert, speaking on behalf of the guests, thanked the Association for its invitation, and said that he was sure that all the guests wished the Association every success. Representative bodies were useful for any community, and in this case he was sure that the Indian Association, by reason of its non-sectarian character, would serve a valuable purpose. Among the guests present at the luncheon were the following :— Mr. H. M. Calvert, the Datu Patinggi of Sarawak, Mr. W. G. Tait, Mr. R. E. Le Sueur. Mr. N. E. Hughes, Mr. II. P. Lansdale-Ruthven. Mr. W. H. Kelley, Mr Lake, Mr G. T Bates, Mr. Tan Sum Guan. Mr. A. P. Merells. Mr. C. S. Were, Mr. V. T. Pillai, Mr. M. I). Deen, Mr. Mohamad Ismail and Sgt. Sheer Singh.

IN THE NEWS: EXTRACTS FROM PRESS TELEGRAMS. SINGAPORE. Miss Hetta Crump, Swedish chairwoman of League of Nations Commission for the Internationalisation of Private Lives, arrived here today with 22 other members of commission by Dutch mail vessel Cornelius Vanderbum. Interviewed by Reuter’s representative regarding objects of commission, Chairwoman Crump, who replied through an interpreter, stated that com¬ mission was designed to eliminate the narrow and pernicious nationalism euphemised by chauvinist politicians as "patriotism.'’ The time has come said Miss Crump when if we are to avoid war we must not only think internationally but live inter¬ nationally, and if this end is to be gained a close measure of supervision of private lives of the peoples of the various countries is essential. Our slogan is “A detective in every living room every diver¬ gence from the international ideal must be ruthlessly exposed, and it will be our duty during this world tour to devise means for carrying this into effect throughout all stales which are members of the League. As a start, it is expected that our preliminary report to the League Secretariat will lay down the principle that no household shall consist solelv of persons of any one nationality. Questioned regarding origin of commission. Miss Crump said this was established following represen¬ tations on the partof Costa Rica, Esthonia. and Paraguay; asked which country was defraying cost of commission. Miss Crump replied "Great Britain. Miss Crump,who received great ovation from the Friends of PeaceSociety and local branch of League of Nations Union before these bodies had to he serrated by police, was unfortunately unable to land at Singapore as she had to tranship immediately for Bangkok. MUTVILLE (Ka.) Sentence of death passed oil nine members of Black Hand League for organis¬ ing holocaust m which 67 negroes were burned alive has been converted by Federal Appeal Court into one of 24 hours simple imprisonment. On conclusion of case Judges Sehinkeu and Würzt shook hands warmly with defendants saying they were glad and proud to greet men in whose hands the great traditions of the South were safe, and who could, they were sure, be relied upon to uphold these traditions. Defendants were subsequently con¬ veyed to their homesamid scenes of wild enthusiasm. . OSKOSH (Pa.) George Shee and Al Burton, un- employed railroad hands, have each been sent to penitentiary for years for robbing a hot dog stand. These sentences which are believed to create a record for the state of Michigan have received general approval, New York Times stating in an editorial that they are proof of America’s return to sanity and evidence that the recent clean-up of judiciary has been effective. HONG KONG. Miss Hetta Crump, it is now known, has published 250-page report on labour and social conditions in Malaya which she says are apalling. "Though investigations into social problems are not strictly speaking within the terms of reference of my commission." Miss Crump told a press representative, "I have taken this opportunity of exposing state of affairs which is deplorable and which cannot be allowed to continue. ’ It is understood that the report has been forwarded to the Colonial Office with a demand for immediate action. LATER. Considerable sensation has been caused by allegations that prominent unofficial member of Hong Kong Leislative Council has publicly referred to Miss Crump as 'interfering busybody” “foul-minded old nuisance” and "nosy parker.” Miss Crump has despatched a series of telegrams to Secretary of State for the Colonies demanding instant arrest of offending member. According to Reuter Secretary of State cabled asking for full particulars of names which Council member is alleged to have railed Chairwoman Crump and when informed replied That goes for me too.” No further action has been taken, and developments are awaited with interest. INDIAN INTERLUDE. “Times have changed. Captain Whistlechick, times have changed, aud India is not the country it was in my young days. Why. to give you an example, when I first came to Bhurraphur. it was enough just to call a donga and say the one word ’club', and the driver took you automatically to the Officer’s Club For of course there was no other club in the Station.—no Sir. no. of course not. of course not. But now—why now damme, if you tell a donga-wallah to take you to the club, the damn'  fella turns  round  and  and  yon WHICH club?” "But Colonel  Birdseed,  I'm  afraid  I  don't quite understand.  Surely there  is  still  only  one club in any station that counts?- only one club, I mean, to which a sahib can belong?—so what can the donga-wallah mean?" "He means, my deah boy, that in Indiah to-day the privilege of belonging to a club is no longer confined only to sahibs.—that's what he means, sir! Why, things have gone so far now that even sergeants have their own clubs: yes. it’s true, my boy. believe it or not. And they tell me that at Patulipatam there's even a club for railway employees! It's a fact. That's what the sahib-log have come down to now in Indiah.- that’ll show you how far we have sunk! Can yon wonder that the natives no longer respect us?” —"Colonel Birdseed, 1-1 don't know what to say.............." (In the background, a figure rises slowly from the earth in the midst of a cloud of saffron- coloured steam. It is the figure of a small English boy, blue-eyed, snotty-nosed, and noticeably adenoidal: he is dressed as KIM, the character Rudyard Kipling has immortalised in his world-famous book of that name. He. raises one pudgy hand impressively.1 THE BOY. Take up the White Bad's Burdéd, Send forth the best ye breed— Go bind your sons to exile To serve your captives' deed— (In the. distance an invisible military band strikes up the first few bars of The Soldiers of the Queen'.) "................ I am quite dumbfounded, Colonel. Surely admittance to the. club—our club, the officers’ club, that is,—is still strictly limited?” ’’Limited?—Pah! How can it be. now that every sort of scum considers he’s the equal of a gentleman who holds His Majesty's Com¬ mission?” "But I mean.........................I take it that one can at least be sure, even to-day. that one will not be forced to risk meeting......................well, P.W.D. people, for instance?” “My deah Captain Whistlechick, we live in a democratic age, and we can no longer pick and choose. It's as well to face the fact; nowadays we are expected to rub shoulders with men our fathers would have horse-whipped out of the compound. Why. I remember at Alighar in ‘93— or was it '92? —old Fosdick-Clutterbuck of the Forty-second ” “Yes, yes. quite. Colonel Birdseed, but to revert to this question of clubs; surely P.W.D. people I mean. Heaven knows I'm not a snob, but after all............... well. I mean to say. P. W.D..........................” "My deah fellow, if they bear the same rank as Civilians it’s impossible to keep ’em out!” ' But there must be a limit?—For instance . ... Posts and Telegraphs?” "Limit be damned! Even they—the senior ones, that is- are members nowadays.” (The small boy bows his head in sorrow, folds his hands, and begins to weep quietly to himself. Between his sobs and snuffles he is heard to mutter— gentiles .... lesser breeds without ... the law .... craved fear .... of being great .... The hidden band takes up the stately strains of the 'Recessional.') "Well, after all you have told me, Colonel Bird¬ seed. I should hardly be surprised to hear that Maharajahs, hahahaha.' and even heads of business firms are allowed into Service clubs!” {Colonel Birdseed totters from his chair, his face a furious purple. He rises unsteadily to his feet, bubbling a little. When at last he speaks it is in a parade-ground roar that carries into the. farthest corners of the club.) “Natives— 1. Boxwallahs—!!. How dare you suggest. such a tiling, Captain Whistlechick ! Are you crazy? No thank God, we have a little pride ieft. even to-day. Natives, indeed ’—Boxwallahs !” THE BOY (Triumphantly.) For East is East and West is West, ad dever the twaid shall beet, Till Earth and sky stand presently ad God’ great judgebent seat! (There is the sound of a loud report, and Colonel Birdseed vanishes. The Small Boy, his snotty nose cocked exultantly in the air, sinks back into the earth with a hiss, his hand at the. salute. The band plays the doxology, then all is silence, but for one of the unemployed humming 'Land of Hope and Glory’ in the street outside. As Captain Whistlechick hears the familiar melody his eyes grow dim: stretching out his hand gropingly, he presses a bell by his side and orders another liqueur brandy.) First Division News. AUGUST. In Kuching a verdict of murder by a person or persons unknown was returned by the Coroner's Court in the inquest on one Habib Abdullah an Arab trader, who was found dead in his house in the Kampong. A proposal that the area bounded by. Green Road. Satok Road, the river, and Nanas Road should be declared Kampong Reserve was submitted to the Resident. At present this area, though outside the Municipal area, is administered by the Municipal authorities on the lines of a Kampong reserve. but householders are really only squatters on Govern¬ ment land. At Bau, a Chinese. Voon Jaw, was shot in the legs by the watchman at Rumoh mine about mid¬ night, August 23rd/24th. It is alleged that he was caught in the act of stealing gold slime from the zinc boxes. Voon Jaw received the charge of buck-shot in the legs at a range of about twelve feet. and one leg was so badly shattered that it was amputated shortly after his admission to the General Hospital. It would appear that he was extremely lucky to escape with his life. An inquiry will be held as soon as Voon Jaw is fit to appear. The Dahan Rubber .Estates harvested 34.000 lbs. of dry rubber during the month. Rainfall at Bau was 5.29 inches, and at Dahan 11.80 inches. It is rumoured that many Dayaks in Upper Sarawak are not planting this year, preferring to depend on rubber for their living. The leading Chinese of Bau and Buso have applied for permission to collect funds for the Sino-Japanese war refugees. They were instructed to apply in writing to the Resident through the District Officer. A Dayak, while buying cartridges at Bau, mentioned that he and another Dayak had met a pair of enormous monkeys while out hunting in the neighbourhood of Dahan. He stated that they had killed one of these with great difficulty, and now intended to go after the second, which, he said, was a female. The Officer-in-Charge of Constabulary District, in whose hearing the story was told, questioned the man, and came to the conclusion that the animal was in fact a maias. The skull of the dead mains was recovered and sent to the Curator. Sarawak Museum, for identi¬ fication. meanwhile all Dayaks have been warned to leave the female alone. It is believed that these two animals came in from Sadong via the Bungo range, and have been living in the mountains round Dahan ever since. The District Officer greatly fears that sooner or later the second one will be killed. At the moment no male Dayak will go along the Dahan road alone, as it is said the female is of an amorous disposition, and is anxious to replace her late lamented husband. The following table gives the. individual output of gold from the various mines for July. 1937 .— On August 10th a report was received at Serian that T. Ĕ Silabu had been murdered in his long house in the ulu Sebangan by one of his anembiak. The alleged murderer. Jalil, who a short time previously had been detained in Simunjan in order to be examined as regards his mental capacity and had been discharged as sane, escaped into the jungle. After a prolonged search he was arrested on August 14th. He has since been committed for trial in the Resident's Court on a charge of murder, and is at present in hospital in Kuching with a view to a medical report being presented to the Court on his mental condition. On August 20th a Land Dayak, who had contracted to make a table for a Serian towkay. duly presented the finished article. Unfortunately, how¬ ever, the table was not up to expectations and the towkay refused to accept it. The Dayak then became violent and seized a bottle of lamp oil from the shop table and dashed it on the pavement. Some uproar was caused in the bazaar and there was a long stream of complainers and counter- complainers to the Kubu. T. K. Balan. a Balau who has been ordered to move out of Melikin territory, has produced a letter purporting to give him permission to remain where lie is. The matter is being reported to the Resident. Fairly good burns are reported in the Serian and Samarahan district. In the ulu Simunjan many houses have planted, but in the Gedong the Melikins have not yet finished felling owing to a recent out¬ break of sickness. At Lundu information was received from Tua Kampong Matusin of Rambungan that an aged Chinese named Chang Chin had been drowned while crossing the Stok River. Two eye-witnesses, Tan Ah Moi and Dillah, shouted at him in order io stop him from crossing the river, as at that time the tide was at its fullest height. They even brought nut a boat to save him. but the deceased disappeared before they could reach the spot. On August 10th. sixteen crocodiles were brought to Lundu Court and killed, and rewards amounting to $12.92 were paid. Cricket. An XI from H.M.S. Herald and the Nondescripts played two matches on the Padungan Recreation Ground during the month—on September 19th and 26th. Both matches commenced at 9.10 a.m., the first finishing at 11.45 a.m. and the second at 12.30 p.m. 19th September, 1937. RACING. SARAWAK TURF CLUB’S AUTUMN MEETING. The Sarawak Turf Club held a very successful three day meeting on September 2nd, 4th and 6th. The first day was fine, but the two succeeding days were showery. All things considered, however, the clerk of the weather was lenient with the watering- can. Many improvements to the Course were noticed since last meeting. By acquiring the whole of that block of land which lies between Sekama Gate and the 5 furlong start and clearing some of the rubber, it is now possible to see the ponies in the long distance races down the back straight. The size of the fields in Division HI made it necessary to alter the three furlong start, and this necessitated the construction of a new winning post and judge's box in front of the bandstand. The extension of rails down the course to the Ara tree is also a great improvement. There were several new comers, and some of them being forward in condition obliged their owners at the first time of asking. Unggut, Chantek Manis and Diana all caught the judge’s eye twice each. Diana is a mare, the first to race here under the present régime; she is extremely fast, and had she been properly ridden might easily have taken the Champion Cup for the best performance at the meeting. Happy Boy IT and Sintak Bulan were both in form and these two good ponies continued their rivalry in the races in which they were allowed to meet, and are becoming the local equivalent of Coronach and Colorado. At this last meeting Happy Boy II had the best of the rubber owing to a rather slovenly race ridden by Asing on Sintak Bulan in the Michaelmas Handicap. Sintak Bulan should have got the verdict by half a length, but was just "pipped” on the post. Happy Boy II equalled record time for the six furlongs on the first day carrying top weight of 10.10 and Sintak Bulan knocked two seconds off the 4 1/2 furlong record carrying 10.2. Happy Boy II took the Champion Cup by a very narrow margin from Silver Blaze, whose demotion from Division I to Division II seems to have roused him to better things. Medin was again the most successful jockey with six winning mounts; he was quite irresistible on the last day, riding four winners out of the eight races. At the conclusion of the meeting Mr. E. Parnell, Officer Administering the Government, kindly gave away the prizes in the absence of His Highness the Rajah. —.B J.C.S. Happy Boy II and Bintang broke the line with Chairman, Kijang, King Kong, Manis and White Label behind in that order. Happy Boy II the favourite took command at 4 1/2 furlongs and ran home a easy winner from Kijang equalling record time for the distance. 1 length, 1 length. Time-1 minute 31 4/5th seconds.

Omar bin Mat, a notorious criminal, who was recently released from Simanggang prison, was again charged with the theft of two bags of padi. He was sentenced by the Simanggang District Court to one and three months’ rigorous imprison¬ ment, and the case was sent to Kuching for con- firmation of sentence. The District Officer, Simanggang, reports with regret the death of Tay Poh Seng of Chop Buan Joo of Simanggang, who died in China on July 19th  1937. Mr. Poh Seng had been trading in Simanggang for more than thirty years, and was well respected locally. Reports have been received that numerous pepper gardens at Pantu are in a bad condition owing to the depredations of pests, which are said to be grubs which attack the roots of the vines, and insects which devour the leaves. The prospect of the pepper harvest in this area is poor. A Malay bangsawan arrived at Simanggang on August 1stand played to poor audiences until the end of the month, when it returned to Kuching. Had the visit been timed to coincide with the next tapping holiday. it would no doubt have proved more lucrative. L. C. Impangg and Constable Usop left Betong to patrol    the    Paku    river    on   August   21st   and   returned on the 26th. Peedes catching unlicensed hawkers buying rubber they found that Chinese had been using explosives to kill fish, as they are not allowed to use tuba. The case will be heard in Court in the near future. Sergeant Rait and three constables visited the Delok and Menyang from August 3rd to 8th to look into a rumour of three Malays said to be selling obat in that neighbourhood. Th© rumour appears to have been without foundation. A crocodile, which had been giving trouble near Rulo, was caught by an alir on the night of August 23rd. It was 12 feet 8 inches long, and very large in size. On cutting it open two gold teeth and some slong were found inside. A brawl occurred at R. Laja, N. Tilek, Kalaka district, daring a gawai antu; nobody was seriously hurt, but it is alleged that the women shut them¬ selves up in their bileks and poured down water and threw burning embers on the men fighting on the ruai below. An inquiry into this is being made. Those con¬ cerned are mostly Babang Dayaks. Third Division News. AUGUST. During the month there was an epidemic of gastric influenza in many parts of the Third Division. Every effort was made to combat this but some people, especially Dayaks, will insist that a plunge in the river is a cure for fever, with generally fatal results. There is no evidence that the epidemic is on the increase, on the contrary it appears to be on the wane. Three Henghua gardeners were tried before the  Sibu District Court for obstructing Rubber In¬ spectors and assaulting them whilst they were on patrol. The three men were sentenced to one year’s rigorous imprisonment each. This case had pre¬ viously been heard in the District Court, but a rehearing had been ordered. Notice of appeal has been given by the accused. The inaugural meeting of the newly constituted Sibu Municipal Board was held on August 6th and a further meeting on 27th. The Board's time is taken up to a great degree at present in formulating a policy for the future and laying down a solid foundation for future work. The Board system promises to be a valuable one once there is an adequate stall to deal with its recommendations. Meetings will take place fortnightly for some time to come owing to the pressure of business. Mr. J. C. B. Fisher arrived in company with the Principal Medical Officer, Dr. E. M. Marjoribanks, on August 3rd and took over the appointment of Assistant District Officer from Mr. S. G. Hansom. The latter proceeded to Kuching with the Principal Medical Officer on 5th, but returned from Sarikei until the 11th. At Sarikei. Wong Sin Chiong, owner of m.l. Sing Hong, was fined $100 for altering the load line marks of his vessel. A number of Dayaks were sentenced to tonne of imprisonment at Binatang for non-payment of fines. Two inquests were held in the Lower Rejang district during the month. The first, at Sarikei, on the body of a male Foochow Chinese named Ching Kah Noo, aged 22, resulted in a verdict of death by misadventure; deceased was drowned in the Sarikei river whilst bathing off the wharf at Jakar. A similar verdict was returned at the inquest at Daro on the body of a middle-aged Melanau woman named Duin. She, together with another woman, was crossing the Batang Lassa, near Tanjong Joljanin. in a small heavily-laden boat, which unable to cope with the quite considerable waves encountered off the Tanjong, became waterlogged and sank. The other woman was rescued by persons in a passing boat, but Duin was drowned. The large vegetable garden at Sarikei continues to do well, and supplied the prisoners with vegetables throughout the month.  Owing to sickness, it seems that many Dayaks in the Lower Rejang district have only just started felling preparatory to planting the new season’s rice crop. The District Officer remarks that if thev are not careful they will, perhaps, get no fine hot weather for a burn, and then the harvest may be a failure. About fifty persons are farming on His Highness the Rajah’s land at Kuala Matu, as bumper crops of rice were obtained there last year. Exports from Sarikei during the month included 7 pikuls of plantation rubber smoked No. 1, 1,499.40 pikuls of plantation rubber smoked No. 2, 107.70 pikuls of fish, 1,751.40 pikuls of white pepper No. 3 and 4,652 ewt. of cutch. The price of sago at Matu dropped during the month from 70 cents to 50 cents per pasu. Uma Pawa and Uma Badang, Ulu Sungei Belaga, held a small tuba fishing in a sidestream resulting in Tuai Rumah Tama Grong and Tuai Rumah Tama Liban being fined $15 each, also 12 doors of Uma Badang and 8 doors of Uma Pawa being fined $5 per door. At Kapit, Tuai Rumah Tama Luhat was fined $10 for refusing to allow the dresser to come up into the house as it was mali rumah, the dresser having been sent on a special trip to Belaga at the earnest request of that district. A wave of petty thieving has started in Song bazaar and Dayaks spending the night on the kaki lima are continually losing property; one party returning from a begawai in Tekalit lost silver belts, etc., to the value of over $120. Dresser Edward Chia returned from Belaga on August 5th, but more deaths were reported from the Pala Wong area, so he was sent up to visit that district. He returned to Kapit on 30th and pro¬ ceeded to Sibu on 31st. The Kapit dresser visited Sg. Melukun and Song during the month. The general health of the district appears to have improved on the previous month, and the epidemic seems to have died out. Penghulu Puso and Constable Boi are still in the Ulu Linau, having been ordered to bring down some Dayaks led by Piling who have been there for nearly six years. These Dayaks are causing trouble with the Punan Busang and this year no mats have been brought in by these Punans for tax. They have been ordered to come down several times, but persistently fail to do so. Dayaks in the Kapit district are late with their farming this year due mainly to the epidemic of gastric influenza, but also partially to the excessive number of beqaweis resulting from last year’s bumper crops. Very few have burnt yet, and the continuous showers towards the end of the month have caused great anxiety, many Dayaks fearing that the dry season has finished. The cost of living in the bazaars in Kapit district is still high and the price of rice has gone up. Little jungle produce is being worked and not much tap¬ ping has been done by Dayaks, who are busy farming. While Abang Indeh's assessment party was walk¬ ing up a small stream in Ulu Katibas, a field-book fell unnoticed into the water. A few minutes later a Dayak dog belonging to one of the party caught them up carrying the dripping field-book in its mouth. An extraordinary case of burglary occurred at Mukah on the night of August 25th or early morning of the 26th. A safe containing $1,596.86 and $600 worth of jewels was stolen from the shop (ground floor) of Towkay Liang Ho. The towkay was sleeping in the room seven yards or so from the safe, and his wife was sleeping in an inner room six feet away from it. The door, which had been barred, had been opened (without tampering) from inside. All the occupants of the house are excluded (for various reasons) from possible guilt. The towkay, before retiring is in the habit of taking a breath of air along the five foot-way, which he did at 10 p.m. or so that evening, and barred the door, which had been left ajar, on retiring. The only solution is that at least two men slipped in and hid behind one of the counters during the towkay’s walk. The next morning two Malay fish sellers (who sell fish opposite the shop) who were asked to help look for the safe found it forty feet inland in a desolate swamp opposite the bazaar, returning within half an hour of leaving the bazaar. These two men were detained on strong suspicion (for other reasons besides this) and the investigation is proceeding. Petty theft appears to be on the increase at Matedeng. chiefly through the foolishness of the victims in leaving cash and valuables in the pockets of coats and unlocked drawers. It has been recommended, however, that a squad of regular police be stationed there, as the sole village constable can no longer be considered adequate. The epidemic of what is said to he gastric influenza is on the increase in the Ulu Mukah, and the dresser made two visits to affected house, although one man can do but little in such a large area. The epidemic of gastric influenza continued to rage in the Ulu Oya throughout the month and, despite preventive measures, attacked all parts of the Interior Area. Reports that there have been more than 100 deaths have yet to be confirmed by the Dresser, who has been up river since the beginning of the month. It seems likely that the epidemic will lead to a shortage of food among Dayaks next year. Few houses have been able to do any preparatory work on the farms. The amount of raw sago exported from the Oya district shows a decrease of eight koyans below the exports for July. The price of raw sago remained fairly steady at 75 cents at Kut and 66 cents at Dalat. On August 27th a spark from a small fire of rubbish set light to the parched grass on the cattle¬ ground adjacent to the Oya bungalow. A few minutes later a high wind sprang up and before Jong the whole field was a blazing mass. With the help of several volunteers from Kampong Oya and the bazaar, however, the fire was got under control before any damage could be done to Government property. Fourth Division News. AUGUST. It is reported that the Chinese pepper gardeners in Niah have broken their temporary agreement with the traders by selling their pepper indepen¬ dently. Their financial dispute cannot be finally settled before the examination of the relevant account books, etc.. has been completed and returned by the Secretary for Chinese Affairs. Mr. D. E. Calver of the Rubber Regulation staff visited Miri and Baram during the month in connection with rubber regulation affaire and coupon issue preliminary arrangements. N.O. Zin Galau, who was discharged from Miri hospital on July 31st. returned to Baram on the 1st, while Datu Tuanku Mohamed was admitted on the 4th. suffering from influenza, and returned to Baram on the 14th. Probationary Native Officers Wan Haji Mohamed and Abang Suleiman left Baram for Kuching on August 21st on transfer, and Wan Ali is being transferred on his return from the Kelabit country. Dayak applications to migrate into the Niah. Sibuti and Suai rivers continue, but are not being encouraged. T R. Chulin with nineteen doors, formerly under T.R. Andam of Niah, was allowed to move to Sibuti. There, has been discontent amongst the anembiak, as Andam has been away in the Second Division for about two years and as a result has lost authority over those inmates of the house who are not his relations. The “Good Shepherd” R.C. Mission School at Marudi was registered during the month. The Chinese. Han Kiang Juan, who attempted to commit suicide on July 4th, 1937, was found insane. He was sent to Kuching on the 27th for detention in the asylum. N.O. Bujang and Rubber Inspector Rozali inspected a few gardens round Miri on August 27th and discovered that even yet many Malays have not understood that they must have one stencil for each separate garden. Some Malays were called to the Courthouse on the 30th, when the Rubber Regu¬ lation rules were again explained to them. The influenza epidemic at Tatau had abated by the end of the month: the total number of deaths amongst Dayaks known to date, due to this sickness, is 64. Dayaks in the Bintulu district have been busy clearing their farms except in the Tatau river, where they are only just beginning to return to their long- houses, having run into the jungle during the influenza epidemic. In Tatau there are many cases where Dayaks have not yet started their farming. The Supervising Surveyor, Mr. R. D. Bull, reports that work on the survey of the rubber gardens in the Bintulu district is progressing satisfactorily. There have been very few cases where the surveyors have been held up. Below are extracts from a report by the District Officer. Limbang and Lawns :— “On August 6th I proceeded to Okong to settle a Dayak dispute between T.R. Bundan and one of his mon which had been causing a certain amount of trouble for some time. On my arrival at Okong. I found that T.R. Bundan had come to an amicable arrangement out of Court. On the 20th I left for the ulu Limbang, accompanied by Upriver Agent Jaya, and reached Rumah Gani Spapit which is the topmost of Dayak houses, having called at all houses on the way up. I slept one night at T.R. Kedu’s house in the Sungei Mernyut, which consists of thirtv-two doors and is by far the biggest house in the district. No complaints were received during any visit. Up¬ river Agent Jaya carried out his customary monthly rounds.” Below are extracts from a report by the officcr- in-Charge, Lawas :— “I visited the Tagals in the ulu Mer-pok and walked from there parallel to the B.N.B. border over to the S. Maputeh, a branch of the lawas Besar. I found all well with the Muruts in the ulu Lawas, and after spend ng a further night up there, came down again to Lawas. There were no cases nor complaints either among the Tagals or the Murats. “Padi farms throughout the district were to be seen in various stages of progress. Some Tagals in ulu Merapok had planted an intermediate crop which looked very healthy and is now about two months old. Elsewhere some natives were on the point of burning off, others were still felling while others had not even completed clearing. Exports of jelutong from Lawas have now for some time been rather low, and the local traders have ceased selling direct to Singapore. Shipments from Lawas are now sent to Miri. The Vamco Timber Company's business has been steadily looking up during the last few months; their monthly turnover is now higher than it has been for a long time, the local market showing good demand. The Lawas (Sarawak) Rubber Estates, Ltd., exported 22,400 lbs. of dry rubber during August. Average rainfall at Lawas has been very low this year, and the figures make strange reading when compared with those for last year. There was an awkward drought in the middle of August, when the river was salt ns far up as Lawas Estate, and they found considerable difficulty in obtaining water to cure their rubber.
