I have never eaten raistaffel though 1 have always wanted to. I think I would like reistafel, consis­ ting as it does of ra—rei—well, rice and taff—taf— tarf—anyhow, table. The people who have eaten riistafle speak very highly of it. An officer of high rank who recently returned from Dutch Borneo told me that rjjsttaflel is the goods—and he knows. He said I must eat rjisstaffl at the earliest opportunity. I do so want to eat raij—reijs—reistt —risstt—oh, darn it I curry and rice is good enough for me anyhow. ‘ What would you do if you were given a million pounds?” asks one of our contemporaries on its competition page. Some people we know would count it. Have you ever noticed how the daily Press News (copyright in all English-speaking countries and the United States of America) commences in a tone of respect and then lapses into familiarity. You know the sort of thing. 'Sir John Simon replying to Mr. Attlee, etc. ” and then, after this touch of the forelock (as it were), they become plain Simon and Attlee. I would like to see it carried further. ‘ In the House of Commons yesterday Mr. Duff Cooper asked Mr. Stanley Baldwin whether he had any information concerning Mr. Antony Eden’s recent speech at Little Spluttering." "Baldwin informed Cooper that he was unaware that Eden had made a speech. But, went on Stanley. 1 can assure you, Duffy-me-lad, that what young Tony said goes for me too. Amid cheers old Uncle Stan sat down.” It has possibilities, don’t you think? FASHION NOTES. One of Kuching's fashionable tailors has let me into the secret of what men will be wearing this coming season- J pass it on so that readers may place their tailoring orders in good time. For office wear a coat of drill de coton with two or three buttons and cut away at the neck will be popular. Trousers will be worn, made of the same material and titled with tin buttons which may be replaced after each visit to the dhobi. For week-ends culotte courte will be de vigour. These will be buttoned round the waist (except after curry tiffin) and will reach to just above the knees. To complete the tout ensemble a chemise d'homme of white, blue or drab will be worn and will be tucked inside the culotte courte. For evening wear the man who wishes to be in the mode will appear in an habit de tutop. This dainty creation is most becoming for it gives a charming effect of a deck steward with a dash of hospital orderly. So now you know! The following advertisement from the Times is printed without comment. "Westminster Abbey, May 12th.—Oak stool, blue velvet seat, used seating distinguished Coronation guests during ceremony, for Sale, apply etc.” THE WALRUS. Greeting Telegrams.

HAMILTON. Printers Ltd., Singapore, $1. The author has adopted an unusual and, what might be, a dangerous method of translation. He has translated the Malay proverb literally into English and rhymed the literal translation with a meaning more comprehensible (presumably) to the English mind. For instance: Buah membachang burak kulit-nya is translated thus : "Horse mangoes have an ugly rind—.” "Sweet natures 'neath rough skins we find." The author is to be complimented on having surmounted (be danger in almost every one of the two hundred proverbs in the book for, though some of the rhymes arc weak, the sense is well inter­ preted. The proverb: Ta'akan pisang berbuah dua kali, is rendered as "Only once does a plantain bear—." "Lost chances never re-occur." One may flinch at the rhyming of "hear” and "re-occur” but as a metaphorical translation the second line is excellent. There is no pretence that this book is a work of literature but its value and interest are undoubted. To quote from the author's introduction: "In order that the reader with some knowledge of the language may avail himself of the opportunity of adding a useful and telling phrase to his speech and, that those without may be tempted to explore the pleasant paths of a simple and delightful tongue, I have added in all cases the translation of the Malay proverb itself.” The author has well succeeded in his objects and the book should prove of value to all students of Malay. Borrowed Plumes. HOWLERS. "The Matterhorn was a horn blown by the ancients when anything was the matter." "A Conservative is a large greenhouse full of hot­ air." "Contralto is a low sort of music which only ladies sing.” "Queen Elizabeth was England’s virgin Queen; as a Queen she was a great success.” Roda (the Rotary Magazine of Malaya.) UPBRINGING. Thoroughly in keeping with the sabre-rattling spirit of the day is the selection of children’s playthings featured in the Christinas catalogue of a Singapore department store. In addition to a wide variety of the old-fashioned lead soldiers, the martial-minded infant can have his choice of a group of armoured cars, tanks, despatch riders mounted on motor-cycles, machine-guns spitting flint sparks, submarines, torpedo boats, zeppelins and warplanes. The catalogue shows a sleek military plane with three bombs just dropping out of the rack. The number of bombs that the machine can cany is specified. It is gratifying to see the toymakers have continued their object lesson by including among the war toys a fleet of gleaming white ambulances. The only thing they have forgotten M a box of tombstones.—(Straits Budget.) TALL STORIES. Overseas newspapers are a happy hunting ground for manufacturers of tall stories about the East and the South Sea Islands. Here is a gem from a Sunday paper in Perth, Western Australia.—“The postmaster of Rangoon, Burma, has asked the homicidal natives of the north to ‘please discontinue sending human heads through the mail.' He sympathises with the custom of sending trophies of the enemy to relatives of the deceased. hut says the mails cannot be used for that purpose." ANOTHER ONE. Even taller-sounding, perhaps, is one from the Daily Mail, a fortnight ago, telling the world that on the seldom-visited isle of Cicohia, in the Fiji group, the natives are extremely scared of huge land crabs because whenever they chase the crabs the crabs turn round and throw dirt or stones at them.—(Straits Budget.) China Relief Fund. A jumble sale in aid of the China Relief Fund was held on October 29th, 30th and 31st at Customs Godown No. 8. The sale was formally opened by Mr. Ong Tiang Swee, c.s.s., his speech being narrated by Mr. Ng Siak Kiong. Both the exterior and the interior of the godown were attractively decorated and at night were electrically illuminated. Thirty-two stalls con­ taining many varieties of goods and staffed by girl helpers tempted the great crowds which came to the sale. A tea-room did brisk business and Mr. Gregory Solosa’s orchestra rendered selections throughout each evening. The Organising Committee were both gratified and worried when it was found that the stalls were almost entirely depleted at the end of the first day. Traders however responded gladly to an appeal for further goods and the stalls were refilled. The three days produced the excellent sum of $6,761.32 and the Organising Committee take this opportunity of thanking the public for such a result. The Committee also have to thank the Chief Secretary for allowing the use of the godown, the Sarawak Electricity Supply Co.. Ltd., for the installation and supply of electricity, the traders and schools who so generously gave the goods for sale and the ladys and gentlemen who acted as helpers. —(Contributed.) The “Driac II.” On November 19th the yacht Driac II arrived at Kuching, the crew consisting of Mr. A. G. H. Macpherson, owner, Mr. W. Leng, mate, and one Malay, Usman. The yacht, twenty-five feet water line and thirty-two feet overall, is of eight tons Thames measurement, Bermuda rigged and flies the burgee of the Royal Cruising Club, few ships of her type can have seen so much of the world in so short a time for, built in 1932, she has already sailed some thirty thousand miles. In September, 1934, the Driac 11 with Mr. Macpherson, Mr. Leng and an American hand, sailed from England on her adventurous voyage. Spain, Portugal, Madeira, the Canary Islands, the Azores, Senegal and the Cape Verde Islands, were visited en route to Bermuda. At the latter port of call the American was landed as a victim to typhoid. The West Indies, Central America and the United States were visited, the ship returning from Charleston, S.C.. to Bermuda aud thence via the Azores and the North Coast of America to Haifa where the ship lay up for a few months. In the Spring of 1936, she sailed from Haifa and through the Greek Islands, the Dardanelles. the Sea of Marmora and the Bosphorus into the Black Sea. On her return, via the Albanian and Yugo­ slavian ports, she put in to Alexandria where she refitted. In October, 1936, she continued her voyage, this time to the East. On account of a headwind the trip from Suez to Perim took fifty days. (It is interesting to note that the fees paid for sailing through the Suez Canal were only thirty-five shillings.) Another headwind made it necessary for her to beat six hundred miles up the Arabian coast to obtain the benefit of the north-east monsoon. Then, via the Laccadive Islands and Colombo, Madras was reached. It was necessary to beat up to Calcutta and thence across to the Mergui Archipelago. Siam and Malaya were visited and then across from Singapore to Kuching. Mr. Macpherson, who is sixty-four, is a member of the Royal Albert Yacht Club and the Royal Cruising Club and is Commodore of the Portsmouth Sailing Club. He formed the well-known Mac­ pherson Collection of old prints and paintings, totalling 12,000 items, and featuring every phase of the sea history of the English-speaking race; the collection being acquired by Sir James Caird, Bart, and presented by him to the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich. Mr. Macpherson is a modest man and he says that during his hazardous voyage he has never met with an adventure, though he admits that he once fell overboard in the Atlantic. The Driac II left Kuching on the 24th on her way to the Dutch East Indies, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the Great Barrier Reef and thence to England via the Cape. Mr. Macpherson may certainly claim the title of the "Modern Ulysses". Films of the Month. Farewell Again.—The reputation of English films has lung been second to none—for being all that films should not be. Various reasons have been assigned for this state of affairs but perhaps one is that the English film companies have slavishly copied their Hollywood brethren, with the result that the treasure house of subjects that England holds has been almost entirely neglected. The man who saw the possibilities in the six-hour stay in Southampton of a troopship is therefore to be com­ plimented, as are the producers of and the players in this excellent film. The cast was above criticism. Leslie Banks as the Colonel was restrained and avoided heroics while the same can be said of Flora Robson as his wife. All the types that go to make up a regiment were faithfully portrayed—the barrack-room lawyer, the gentleman ranker, the concertina man with a taste for the maudlin, the crown-and-anchor players, the quarrelsome soldiers’ wives whose enmity turned to sympathy at the agonies of birth—all these charac­ ters were shown without exaggeration and without sentimentally. Based upon an actual occurrence, one cannot help feeling that the film voiced many of the dramas that actually lay behind the real-life incident. This film makes one hopeful of Elstree. Lloyds of London.—America, and not England, realised that the story of an English institution iruown to and respected by the whole world could be made into a powerful film. And right well the producers succeeded. Freddie Batholomew, who, it is pleasing to note, seems to be losing a natural aptitude for the lead in "Eric, or Little by Little" (assuming that the book should be filmed) played Blake as a boy in a convincing manner, Tyrone Power successfully playing the same character as a man. Sir Guy Standing gave a pleasing interpretation of Anger- stein and George Sanders was well cast as Lord Stacy though Madeleine Carroll was of too hard a type for the part of Lady Elizabeth. The sea pictures were well portrayed and the death of Nelson was shown in a minor key, the temptation to strike loudly the notes of the famous signal and the great sailor's dying Words being resisted. This film will be remembered. One in A Million.—This picture featured Sonja Henie, the groat skater. One is generally fearful that were a star of sport is starred in a film there will lie two results—the star will be quite incapable of acting, talking or even being pleasing to the eye and despite these failings, the star will monopolise the screen. Sonja Henie acted and talked well, she was good to look upon and she did not monopolise the film. Also, her skating was superb, expressing as it did the poetry of motion. Throughout the film humour was abundant. The Ritz Brothers fooled to perfection while Borrah Minevitch and his band were extremely funny. Adolphe Menjou as the impresario and Arline Judge as his long-suffering wife provided further comedy. Kind Lady.— This was a good film of its kind. The suspense was well maintained but the end was weak and almost incomprehensible. Aline Mac­ Mahon played the part of Mary Herries well, though at times there was a feeling that she should be well shaken into the realization that she was behaving with almost imbecilic stupidity. Basil Rathbone as the bad man of the piece was all that a smooth­ tongued villain should be. Camille.—The ghost of Sardou, if it saw this film, must have emitted sepulchral groans. Robert Taylor as a young man about Paris may have looked the part but did not sound it. It was a pity he should have to buy, what he pronounced as “Marrong glassy.” Plain “Candies” would have sounded so much better. Greta Garbo provided further evidence to those of her critics who consider her as being overrated and over-publicised. Her lines were for the most part unintelligible. How­ ever, she died very nicely though, like Charles II, she was au unconscionable time a-doing it. During the month The Marriage of Corbal was shown. Any doubts as to the world’s worst film are removed. Don Donald starred Donald Duck and his girl friend, whose name seems to be unknown. Donald was at his best as a dashing gaucho lover. The remainder of the films of the month were mediocre. First Division News. OCTOBER. Crime in Kuching during the month consisted of two cases of assault, seven of theft, one of cheating, thirty-one of breach of Municipal by­ laws, one of breach of Customs and Shipping Regula!ions and fifteen other offences. The following are extracts from the report of the District Officer, Kuching :— “On 3rd I visited Muara Tebas to inspect possible bazaar sites, later walking to Bako via Goebilt. At Bako I arranged the allocation of the new bazaar sites returning to Kuching by Chinese launch. The Chinese at Bako seem very keen on the new bazaar and are unanimous in asking that they be allotted entirely separate sites for fish cooking and drying instead of the proposed extension to the bazaar lots. It was arranged that the Resident, First Division, Assistant Superintendent of Lands and I should visit Bako early in November to decide the final lay-out. "The Kampong Patingan schedules were received from the Land Office during the month and a start was made with the writing up of the register. A form of registration card for Kampong lots was approved and printed during the month. These have been issued to lot holders at Kampongs Santubong, Bako. Muara Tebas and Goebilt and will be issued to lot holders in Kampongs Sekama and Batingan as soon as they are written up.” The following are extracts from the report of the Assistant District Officer, Kuching :— “At the 7th mile bucket latrines have all been completed, and the contractor’s work is satis­ factory. The bazaar is kept clean and neat by the scavenging contractor, and it is both surprising and encouraging to note that the shopkeepers have stopped dumping refuse all over the bazaar area. Buildings in the bazaar area have been assessed for the first time, the annual value being $2,622 on which a rate of 10% will be charged in 1938. 1937 assessment revenue is about $40. At the 10th mile the building of two new shops started on the newly-filled sites. No attempt is being made to introduce proper latrines until the old houses have been demolished. A prison gang is making good progress in filling the road-reserve between the two blocks of shop-houses, and the P.W.D. are tracing the course of underground springs preparatory to putting in culverts and a stone- faced drain down the new road. The area has been assessed at an annual value of $1,770 on which a rate of 7 1/2% will be charged in 1938.” A police patrol discovered a fire on the Yamashita estate near Jugan and were able to extinguish it. Arson is suspected but no arrests have yet been made. The work of settling the land rights at Kampong Skiat will shortly be undertaken by the District Officer, Bau, and the Assistant Superintendent of Lands. Work has commenced on the erection of a rubber coupon office at Bau The vegetable market was completed and will shortly be opened. The following table gives the individual output of gold from the various mines. Serious outbreaks of bacillary dysentery were reported among the Land Dayaks in the Ulu Badong. The dresser treated thirty people for the complaint at Tebekang, while on his arrival at Keresen he found that four people had died and oe hundred and thirty were suffering from it. The extracts given below are from the report of the District Officer, Sadong and Samarahan :— "During the month the specimen coupons were received and intensive propaganda work has been carried out with their assistance. They are really of immense value in enabling the propagandist to convey the essentials of the system to his audience. Previously the ubiquitous match had invariably to provide the necessary aid as an exhibit. Malays have been particularly quick to understand the principles involved and on the whole the response of the Dayaks is most gratifying. The word "coupon" seems tn be preferred to ticket, jual getah, and if this is the experience of other districts, perhaps the official terminology will have to be altered accordingly. A rumour has been circulating round the district that the Government is encouraging the building of smoke-houses by natives only because it wishes at a later date to impose a tax of $5 per smoke­ house per annum. I am very anxious to trace the source of this peculiarly wicked invention and suspect that it originated in the ingenious brain of some imaginative towkay. The ground check of stencils in the Ulu Sebangan and Patang Kiri was a somewhat disastrous experience A rough examination appears to shew that nearly twenty-five per cent of the names given to the inspector (many of which I understand he obtained from O.T.’s) were different from the names given to the officers who issued the number plates. The explanation for the dis­ crepancy is generally that the garden is regarded as belonging to the family, and one day the name of the father is given as the owner and the next day the name of the son. I do not know how strict the rule that coupons at the first issue can be given only to holders is going to be, but I suggest that it will be necessary to vest a good deal of discretion in the hands of the supervising officer, and to treat the production of a stencil as very strong evidence of ownership. "The most notable event of the month has undoubtedly been the pasting dua kali in Simunjan. I was not present to witness this phenomenon myself, but it is substantially authenticated by reliable observers, including the Native Officer. The facts are these. At 4 p.m. on the 14th there was an exceptionally large “bore” and then, at approximately 4.30 p.m. it was noticed that the tide was surut again. This surut continued for about 1 1/2 hours and then at 6 p.m. came the proper pasang (this time without a "bore”) which lasted for the usual period. The oldest inhabitants say that this phenomenon last occurred ninety years ago (I suppose that fifty would be nearer the mark), when it heralded a great and devastating sickness. It is feared that this may be the result this time also, though many people predict other direful consequences, and I have been asked many times to give the official inter­ pretation of this freak of nature.” The death is reported of Pengarah Sinjan at Kampong Raso. Lundu District, on the 20th. Kuching Football Association. The Football season in Kuching for 1937 was dominated by the display of the Medical 1st XI. In all probability this team was the best football machine that has been seen in Kuching since the League started and Dr. Marjoribanks is to be congratulated on the result of his untiring efforts. There was one thing that marred football in Kuching and it was noticeable during the whole season. That was dirty play and unnecessary fouling. It should be realised by now by all players that the idea of "if you can’t play the ball play the man” is definitely not one of the golden rules of football. The use of the elbow when charging a player, following through after clearing the ball, lifting the knee at the right moment if someone should be brave enough to tackle a player straight, attempted tripping: all these constitute petty fouls and tend to fray tempers. The revolting habit of players, probably through sheer fright, taking a flying leap into an opponent was also noticed. Those shortcomings are prevalent in all the teams, and players who should know better were the worst offenders. If football is to continue in Sarawak this dirt \ play will have to disappear. During the season the old problem of efficient referees turned up as, we are afraid, it always will. Touch line referees must try to remember that refereeing football in Sarawak is not a pleasure by any means and furthermore it is much easier to award penalties and so forth from the touch line than it often is on the field. It is also very difficult for anyone who has played good football to turn himself into an efficient referee at a moment’s notice, no matter how well he may know the rules of the game. The problem of the first division was solved effectively by Mr. MacDonald who offered to referee all first division matches. He refereed twenty or thirty games with absolute impartiality and efficiency and all players under his control realised that he would put up with no nonsense. Our thanks are due to Mr. MacDonald for undertaking this unpleasant job. Unfortunately the. problem of satisfactory refereeing in the second division remained unsolved. In retrospect the season was dominated by the Medical and the knowledge of an eight goal defeat rather took the joie de vivre out of their opponents. However they must be complimented on their remarkable display of football both as a team and as individuals. Tn the cup matches both the Medical teams took all the honours as usual in a most decisive way. Looking forward to 1938 the prospects are not bright. The financial side of the question in positively depressing. Owing to the lack of response from the general public the collections from the seating round the ground were most disappoint­ ing. The cost of the league medals and the use of the ground consumed all but a few dollars of the cash at the disposal of the Council. Therefore unless some concrete scheme for the reorganization of the Football Association can bo found, on financial grounds alone there will be no league in 1938. The results of the league and for the cup matches are shown below. Constabulary March. Sarawak Anthem. The usual monthly dance was held on the 5th. On the 16th a Mah Jong Drive resulted in Mrs. Parnell winning the first prize and Mrs. Middlemas the second. On the 23rd a Bridge Drive attracted Mrs. Baird being the winning lady and Mr. Dick the winning gentleman. On Armistice Day a Flanders Poppy stall was placed: on the verandah and $309 was collected, which, together with contributions from the Third Division and Betong, brings the total to date to $669. In the evening the ex-Service men held their dinner, the large room being gaily decorated with flags. The Constabulary band played throughout the meal and the "old sweats" joined lustily in the choruses of the wartime songs. A dance followed, to which all Club members were invited, and the music for which was provided by the band. DECEMBER PROGRAMME. Friday, 3rd. Monthly dance, 9.30 p.m. Thursday, 23rd.

On the 21st ex-Penghulu Majeng’s house of nine doors in the Skrang was burnt to the ground with a complete lose of property. Every man was away on the farms at the time, entirely contrary to adat and local order which insists that two rooms must remain in the house. The contract has been signed for the erection of five Junior Service quarters at Simanggang and they will be completed within three months. Mr. F. Harding, Posts and Telegraphs Depart¬ ment, visited Simanggang and Belong during the month in connection with proposed telephone linw connecting Betong, Spaoh and Debak and Saratok with the rest of the telephone system of the Division. Mr. Crawford. Chief Assessor, also visited Simang¬ gang. Thay Teng Thong was unanimously elected Capitan China, Lingga, in place of Lim Ann Soon who has resigned. Contracts were signed for the building of four Junior Service quarters and Coupon Issuing office at Betong. Temporary quarters and an office at Debak were completed. Spaoh Fort was completed on the 21st. On the 30th it was reported that three Dayaks had stolen rubber from a house at R. Nuga, Engkala, Krian. The rubber was recovered that evening by Corporal Omar. The District Officer and two Rubber Inspectors proceeded up river next day and two of the Dayaks were met. They stated that Asum. the third culprit, had gone to Litok Ulu Julaw. By walking all day and night, Sait’s langkaw kebun was reached early next morning. As soon as Asum realised that lie had been discovered he dived from the back of his mosquito net through the attap into the jungle, a drop of some ten feet, clad only in his sarong. Pursuit was impossible. Asum is a Kabo Dayak who has been in prison before. He has a wife and children and it is thought he will return to his house sooner or latter. Ong Ho San, ex-Capitan China, Saratok, died on the 7th. He was a much respected member of the Chinese community and he received his Long Service Decoration in 1934. The District Officer, Lubok Antu, reports an interesting example of Iban superstition. Barieng anak Rantai of Nanga Mujan fell ill and a manang was called in who decided that the illness was caused by the patient cutting down a kara tree which was the dwelling place of an antu. Offerings were accordingly placed near the stump of the tree as propitiation and Rantai was instructed to leave a space around the stump unplanted with padi. As a result of this treatment Barieng showed great improvement and was able to walk about and bathe in the river. Rantai, unfortunately, neglected the instructions of the manang and some time later planted pndi around the tree stump. That evening Barieng again fell ill and died three days later. The Officer-in-Charge, Simanggang, together with Mr. Sciotling, Rubber Assessor and Abang Zin, Native Officer, toured the Sungei Skrang district from the 2.5th to November 4th. Third Division News. OCTOBER. During the month all the rickshaw coolies at Sibu went on strike and were still so at the end of the month. All efforts to come to terms have failed, the Government not having the support of the Chinese members of the Municipal Board. The strikers claim that the Chinese themselves are importing Japanese goods and they refuse to carry them. The Chief Justice visited Sibu and heard two appeals on the 6th and 7th. Two inquests were held at Sibu during the month. In the case of Then Lee Siew, Kheh, who hanged himself, a verdict of suicide while mentally depressed was returned. A verdict of death by misadventure was returned in the case of Ling Sui Leng, a Foochow girl of two years of age, who was found drowned in a well. Orang Kaya Dana, a pensioner of Sungei Assan, father of ex-Penghulu Lingoh, died at Sibu on the 7th. A new Dayak resthouse, Native Officer’s quarters and a European bungalow have been completed at Sarikei. The old Dayak resthouse is to be reno¬ vated and converted into Public Works and Forest offices. An inquest at Binatang on Tiong Nguk Ing, a Foochow girl of 18, who was drowned at the mouth of the Binatang river, resulted in a verdict of misadventure. A similar verdict was returned in the case of an elderly Melanau, Jaloh bin Aden, who was drowned in the Simpang Aor after falling from his boat while loading bark. On the morning of the 26th Mr. J. B. J. Radford, Supervising Surveyor at Matu, found that a wrist watch and $39 were missing from his bungalow. Four drums of benzene were missing from the store. The outboard engine had been removed from Mr. Radford’s boat and dropped into the river and a 25-gallon drum of oil upset and allowed to drain out. Investigations into the crime are still being carried out. Prospects of a good rice crop in the Wak and Ulu Julau are poor, due to the delay in burning and planting caused by the cessation of work at each death from influenza. Much damage was done to Government property at Sarikei by a typhoon which occurred on the 14th. The roof of the Settlement Officer's house was partly blown off and seven other buildings required repairing. A verdict of accidental death was returned at an inquest on Yeo Ewe Mee, a Kheh woman, who was found drowned in Sungei Bliti, Kapit. Two Dayaks at Kapit were found in possession of home-made guns. These guns consisted of a length of piping blocked up at one end with lead and affixed to a wooden stock. Since then two more such weapons were found in the Kapit District and two at Song. It is stated that there are many more in existence. The Dayaks were quite astonished when told in Court that such contraptions were liable to blow up into their faces when fired. A storm of exceptional violence struck Melanau on the 16th, temporary quarters being blown down, furniture being thrown across the Fort while several fruit trees were uprooted. One of the latter crashed into the new police barracks and did considerable damage to the roof. As a result, several fruit trees behind the barracks have been felled as they constitute a danger to life and property. The tendency of the Oya Dayaks to leave their long houses and split up into permanent dampa is again in evidence. They have been warned that the customary fine of half pikul a door will in future be enforced in such cases. A series of violent, storms caused great damage at Oya and Dalat. The greatest sufferers were owners of houses with leaf attap roofs which were blown in all directions. One tree was blown across the Sungei Hud bridge and another struck a woman as she was bathing in the river. The bamboo avenue at Oya was further denuded. The schooner Hock Choon of forty-two tons was blown ashore at Penipah in a gale on the 14th and is a total loss. A Dayak woman named Amun committed suicide at Balingian by drinking tuba juice. Fourth Division News. OCTOBER. Rough weather at Miri caused great dislocation to shipping arrangements. H.H.M.Y. Maimuna was unable to land a rubber surveying party which included Mr. Jackson and was also unable to enter Kuala Baram. Shelter was taken off Brooketon for some days and, after refuelling at Labuan, she proceeded to Brunei where the party were landed. The party (ravelled overland via Belait to Kuala Baram and travelled up river to Marudi. M.L. Doreen broke her rudder and was forced to anchor in the roads for eight days, eventually being towed in by a Sarawak Oilfields launch. No damage was caused to the engine or hull but the crew reported that at times rain almost swamped the vessel. S.S. Kajang arrived from Singapore on the 13th but was unable to discharge cargo. A Govern¬ ment nightsoil lorry had to be overcarried. When landed on the 23rd it. was found that several tools were missing. S.S. Darvel was also unable lo work cargo and left without the mail. The District Officer, Bintulu, reports that the Dayaks, Kayans and Bintulu Melanaus show signs of prosperity. The latter are benefiting from the con¬ struction of the landing ground as all the work on the ground is being carried out by local contractors. The progress of the work is evidence of the Melanaus' capacity for hard and continuous manual labour. The following extract is taken from the report of the District Officer, Limbang :— "On the 30th Chop "Soon Bee” of Sundar applied here for permission to export from Limbang and Lawas Districts baulk timber such as Siangan batu, kapor, etc. He informs me that he has arranged to export this timber direct to Singapore by a motor Tongkang of 150 tons thereby saving freight and re-shipment charges from here to Labuan and Labuan to Singapore. This scheme, if successful, will mean a consider¬ able amount of employment for local inhabitants and also a direct line of shipping from here and Lawas to Singapore.” The Officer-in-Charge, Lawas District, reports that rubber planters and dealers have adopted a very sensible attitude to the coupon scheme and all appear to understand the procedure. This is probably due in part to their proximity to British North Borneo and Brunei. The Borneo Company, Limited. 144TH ORDINARY GENERAL MEETING. The One Hundred and Forty-fourth Ordinary General Meeting of the Company was held on the 13th October, 1937, at the Registered Offices of the Company, 143-149, Fenchurch Street, London, E.C. 3. Sir Adam B. Ritchie (Chairman of the Company) presided. The notice convening the meeting and the Auditors’ Report having been read by the Secretary, the Chairman apologised for the unavoidable absence of Mr. A. Whitworth, one of the Directors, and proceeded :— I presume that, as in previous years, you will allow me to take as having been read the minutes of the last Annual General Meeting, and also the Directors’ Report and Accounts for the past year. Before reviewing the accounts and our operations during last year, I must refer to a change which has occurred in the membership of your Board since our last meeting. Mr. A. A. Jamieson has felt for some time that his responsibilities in other directions have made it increasingly difficult for him to devote the necessary time to the work of the Company, and be accordingly decided that he must resign his membership of the Board at the end of our last financial year. I need hardly tell you that it was with sincere regret on the part of myself and of my colleagues that his resignation was accepted. This Company owes much to Mr. Jamieson, who has been actively connected with it during the past seventeen years, having been a member of the Board from 1922 onwards, and having acted as Chairman of Directors for five years. I am sure that everyone, present will join With me in recording our appreciation and thanks to him for his valuable work in the Company’s interests in the past, and our regret that circumstances should have made it necessary for him to break a connection which has been such a happy one for us all. We have been fortunate in persuading Mr. J. W. Hely-Hutchison to join us in Mr. Jamieson's place, and it gives me much pleasure to introduce him to you to-day. Mr. Hely-Hulchison has for long taken a keen interest in the Company's fortunes. To many of you he will be known as a partner in Messrs. George Henderson & Sons, and as a Director of several other companies His intimate knowledge and experience of business in the East will be of great help to us in guiding the affairs of the Company. During last winter Mr. A. R. Malcolm, who is your General Manager in London, spent several months in visiting the Company’s properties in the East, renewing old acquaintances, and gaining much useful information of existing conditions in the various territories in which we are trading. I am pleased to inform you that on his return Mr. Malcolm was able to report to the Board very favourably on everything which he saw in the East, and especially on the ability and keenness of the Staff. The discussions which he was able to have on the spot proved most profitable in arriving at prompt conclusions which otherwise would have taken up time in interchange of correspondence. In addition to our own direct interests, Mr. Malcolm visited the properties of our Subsidiary Companies, the Haboko Tea Company, Limited, in Sumatra, also Borneo Motors, Limited, and Alexandra Brickworks, Limited, in Malaya, and was impressed by the efficient manner in which the management of all three companies is being conducted. He was struck in particular with the healthy aspects of the Tea and Rubber Estates of the Haboko Tea Company, Limited, and with the improvement and development which had taken place on both Estates since his visit four years previously. The gratifying improvement in our trading results for the past year as shown in the accounts which are before you may, in the main, be attributed to the unexpected and abnormal rise which took place in the prices of all commodities during the latter six months of our financial year, and especially of those commodities in which we are either directly or indirectly interested, viz., Teak, Tea, Tin and Rubber. Simultaneously the prices for manufactured goods were also increased, enabling us to earn enhanced margins upon our stocks of merchandise which moved freely into consumption, through the increased buying power of our customers. I must confess that at one period I was sceptical of the underlying reasons for the rapid rise in demand and prices, coming as it did at the time of the publication of the enormous re-armament, programmes of this country and other Powers, and was afraid that a bubble was being created which might burst at any time, In point of fact this is what happened, in a minor degree, during the set-back of last spring when the element of speculation became apparent, but the conditions for business generally were found to be resting upon sounder foundations than I think was generally believed. I am pleased to say that this is confirmed by the progress we have made in our business so far during this financial year, which makes me hope that our profits may he increased. The future, however, has again been obscured by recent complications of the political situation in Europe, and especially by the outbreak of war between China and Japan. We ail hope that thia conflict will not be continued for long, but its effects upon so important a market as China are difficult to foresee and are bound to remain as a disturbing influence on all trade in the East for some time after peace has been restored. In our Teak business, the quantities of logs extracted from our forest concessions in Siam were well up to our mill requirements and showed a slight improvement both as regards size and quality, but the unusually early ending of the rains last, year, and the consequent drying up of the creeks utilised for transport, caused con¬ siderable difficulty in extraction and proved exceptionally Lard upon the elephants employed in dragging the logs. It may be of interest to you to know that we have a herd of over two hundred trained elephants working in our forests, and the photographs which you see hanging on the walls around you, and which were recently taken on the give a very good indication of the work which those animals do. One must see them at work, however, in order to appreciate how almost human they are in their methods of collecting and hauling logs, and how indispensable they are in any tropical forest organisation. As regards the renewal of our Forest Leases, which expire in 1940, I am sorry that I have again no news to give you. It is hoped that the Government of Siam will within the next few months make known the terms upon which they are prepared to accept applications for renewal of Leases, and that when we meet again next year I shall be able to tell you whether or not our interest in Teak will be continued. On the marketing side of our business, sales of Teak, both as regards volume and prices, con¬ tinued to improve throughout the year, and after December last temporarily reached something like boom conditions in common with all other commodities. Our supplies available are, of course, rationed by the quantities of logs which we estimate our forests will produce, but between September of last year and March of this year prices increased by no less than about 25 per cent., and so turned what was a loss up to December last into a moderate profit at the end of the year. One satisfactory feature of our business last year was the renewal of sales of rough timber logs to the Chinese saw-millers in Bangkok, indicating revival in demand from China, which used to be the backbone of our business. Unfortunately, this outlet has again been closed by the Sino-Japanese War, and from other directions also there has during the last few months been a falling off in demand, due I think to buyers having stocked themselves up with cut timber when prices were rising. Il is accordingly a little difficult to estimate what the results from our Teak business this year will be. The Merchandise section of our business proved successful, the value in turnover of all branches having increased by 106 per cent, over the previous year. The major portion of this increase was secured in Malaya, which is easily our largest market, but satisfactory increases were also recorded by Siam and Sarawak in consequence of the improved trading conditions during the latter half of the year, full advantage of which was taken by our Managers and Staff. We cannot, of course, hope to continue to expand our business al this rate, but 1 am pleased to say that the increase in turnover which we secured last year has been maintained this year so far, and provided the prices for Tin and Rubber keep up at round about the level of the past few months, thug maintaining the purchasing rower of our customers, we may hope for additional profits from our trading during the year. At our meeting here two years ago I mentioned that steps were being taken to reorganise our merchandise business on a more secure footing, and the results of this reorganisation are now beginning to bear fruit, through the wider distribution and increased efficiency of our marketing organisation. Our produce business, which is confined mainly to the export of Rice from Siam, earned a small profit last year, which in all the circumstances was satisfactory. Trading conditions were difficult in consequence of the uncertainty which prevailed regarding the imposition of Duties on Imports into Cuba, which is our largest market for Siam Rice, and because of a shortage in the Siam Crop which caused heavy losses to some of the local Rice Millers in Bangkok in the early months of this year. The prospects for our Rice business this year are not loo good, and I shall be satisfied if we are able to break square. The results from our Tea and Rubber Estates in Sumatra proved more satisfactory owing to the higher prices ruling for both Tea and Rubber, and for the first time in seven years the Tea Estate was aide to earn a surplus over and above cost and depreciation. The Tea Crop amounted to 900,568 lbs. at an average manufactured cost of 6.48d. per lb. f.o.b. exclusive of depreciation, from the sale of which we secured an average f.o.b. return of about 7 3/4d. During the current year the quota allotted to the Tea Estate under the Tea Restriction Scheme is approximately the same figure as last, which we estimate will be produced at a slight reduction on the costs of last year. Provided, therefore, that the present prices which we are securing on sales are maintained. I anticipate that the Tea Estate will return a larger surplus than last year. Commercial production of Rubber was com¬ menced in May, 1936, on the completion of the Rubber factory, but output was limited by the fact that tappers and factory workers had to be trained in their work, and the production figures are therefore not of mirth value. The total amount of Rubber sold, together with the proceeds of unused Quota Rights disposed of, exceeded cost of production and maintenance charges. The Quota to be allotted to the Rubber Estate this financial year under the Scheme for Rubber Restriction cannot yet be definitely ascertained, but we are estimating for a crop of over a million pounds at an estimated f.o.b. cost of about 3 1/4d. per lb. Here again, if Rubber prices are main¬ tained round about the present level we shall secure an increase in revenue from our Rubber Estate. The total amount of surplus revenue secured from the combined Tea and Rubber Estates last year, after debiting depreciation, but without charging any interest on advances made by the Borneo Company for development purposes, amounted to £12,550, and this sum has been included in our profits. At the same time, as you will gather from our Report, it has been decided to take £50,000 from our General Reserve Account and utilise this money in writing down the amount of advances which we have made to the Haboko Tea Company for development purposes and which appears in our Balance Sheet under the heading of 'Advances to and Amounts due by Subsidiary Companies.” I should here explain to you that Hie capital of the Haboko Tea Company, Limited, is purely nominal, and that the money for ‘development and maintenance costs has been provided entirely from advances made by our Company. The book value of those advances at the end of our financial year amounted to £360,028, which represents a capitalised value of about £69 per acre, inclusive of factories and other buildings, of the combined areas planted under Tea and Rubber. This valuation, as I have more than once pointed out to you, is, in the opinion of your Board, too high, and you will recollect that one of the proposals under the Scheme for the Recon¬ struction of the. Capital of the Company, which was placed before you at the end of last year, was to write down the amount of those advances by £146,340. Whether or not in the more favourable conditions now ruling for the production of both Tea and Rubber it may be necessary to reduce those advances by so large a sum remains to be considered, but it is the intention of your Board to utilise surplus revenue if and when it is available to write down those advances to a figure which will more closely represent the real value of both Estates. Tn commenting upon the value at which those Estates stand in our books. I do not wish to infer that the physical condition of both Estates is not all it should be. Under the careful super¬ vision of Messrs. Harrisons & Crosfield, Limited, who manage those Estates for us in the East, both Estates are being maintained in first-class order. Our subsidiary Companies in Malaya, Borneo Motors, Limited, and Alexandra Brickworks, Limited, both experienced satisfactory trading years. From our holding in Borneo Motors, Limited, we secured a dividend of 10 per cent., and I anticipate that the dividend for this year may be slightly increased. The profits made by Alexandra Brickworks, Limited, were applied towards reduction of the losses carried forward from previous years. These losses will be entirely liquidated this year, when I hope a commencement may be made in paying off the arrears of Preference Share dividend which date from 1st January, 1932. We hold onlv Ordinary Shares in Alexandra Brick- works, Limited, so 1 am afraid it will be some time yet before we can expect to receive any dividend on our holding. 1f you will turn now to the Balance Sheet, there are only one or two items which I wish to comment on. On the Liabilities side you will notice additions have been to our Reserve Account of £33,000. This sum is made up of £14,000 taken from our profits as shown in the Profit and Loss Account, plus a sum of £19,000 transferred from Investment Reserve Account which at the close of our financial year amounted to £47,070, a figure whieh was considered to be unnecessarily large for the risks involved. I have already explained the reasons for the withdrawal of £50,000 from the Reserve Account. The amounts due by the Company, including Bank Overdrafts, show an increase during the year of £42,234, which is reflected on the other side of the Balance Sheet in an increase in the Stocks of Merchandise of £46,837. The Liability for Bills Payable shows a large increase over the previous year, but this is purely fortuitous and is due to large stocks of produce having been accumulated and awaiting shipment on the 31st March last. 1 have no comment to make on auy of the items on the Assets side of the Balance Sheet, except to point out the increase in the Stock of Merchandise and Amounts due to the Company, indicating the extent of the expansion in our Merchandise business during the year. In the Profit and Loss Account you will notice that the amount shown as Profit for the year has been arrived at after deduction of sums provided for Bud Debts and Stock Depreciation, whereas during the previous five years these have been debited to General Reserve. Yon will notice that no provision has been made for any liability for Income Tax or for the National Defence Contribution. We have been advised that as the N.D.C. does not apply to accounting periods ending prior to 1st April, 1937, we are not liable for any contribution this year; and further that the losses from previous years, which we arc entitled to carry forward when computing our Assessment for Income Tax, are more than sufficient to cover any Assessment which we might otherwise be liable for on the Trading profits for last year. I have no further comments to make on the Balance Sheet, but Shareholders will have an opportunity of asking questions, which I shall be pleased to reply to before putting the Resolutions to the meeting. That, Ladies and Gentlemen, concludes all I have to say on the Accounts and on our business during the past year, but before sitting down I should like to say just a word or two regarding the Scheme for the Reconstruction of the Capital of the Company which was placed before you at the end of last year, and was later withdrawn by your Board, as you were advised at the time. The reasons which decided your Board to withdraw the Scheme were, firstly, because of a considerable amount of opposition from Ordinary Shareholders whose objection, I understand, was that the application of the Scheme would prove unreasonably harsh on their interests; and, secondly, the unexpected improvement which occurred in the Teak section of our business after September, 1936, which would have made it difficult to substantiate before the Court the future losses which we had estimated would accrue in a continuance of the conditions ruling six months previously when the Scheme was drawn up. I confess that I was deeply disappointed when the Scheme had to be withdrawn, because I felt then—as 1 feel now—that, looking to the future, the proposed Reconstruction of our Capital was in the best interests of both classes of Shareholders, and especially of the Ordinary Shareholders. If the Scheme had been passed the Ordinary Share¬ holders would to-day have received a substantial dividend in place of nothing at all—and with the prospect of receiving nothing for some years yet. Further, the Reconstruction of the Capital would have been of immense benefit to the Company by enabling us to make use of opportunities for expansion in our business, which, for lack of free capital available for issue, we are at present unable to do. We are left with the knowledge that at least one of our assets, the Tea and Rubber Estates, must be further written down. Also, it is essential that our Rosenes must be built up again; and the money for those purposes can only be found out of profits which would otherwise be available for the payment of Ordinary Dividends. I think it Is desirable that I should explain our position to you in case the more optimistic views which I am able to take of our trading results in the current year may tend to raise false hopes. It is not at present the intention of your Board to initiate any further proposals towards altering the Capital of the Company. Lastly, it gives me pleasure to commend to you the services of your Managers and Staff during the past year, both at home here and in the East, and I hope that I have your authority to convey to them an expresssion of your appreciation. The results which we are considering here to-day could not have been achieved without the whole-hearted co-operation of everyone—a characteristic of our Managers and Staff which I am happy to say can always be relied upon. The Chairman then moved the adoption of the Report and Accounts. This was seconded by Mr. J. K. Henderson, and the Chairman, after replying to quotums, put the resolution to the meeting, and the Report and Accounts were unanimously adopted. The re-ejection of Mr. J. W. Hely-Hutchison and Mr. J. K. Henderson to membership of the Board having been proposed by the Chairman, and seconded by Mr. H. A. Trotter, was unanimously agreed to. The Auditors, Messrs. Turquand, Youngs & Co., were re-appointed for the current year. Mr. R. S. Robertson, in proposing a hearty vote of thanks to the Managers and Staff at home and abroad, referred to the difficulties of recent years and continued :— ‘‘This year it is a great pleasure to be able to thank the Staff for some real and tangible results, and the Chairman in his speech has told us how far the Managers and Staff have been responsible for those results. I hope you, Sir, will convey to all of them our congratulations, and best wishes for their continued success.” The Chairman thanked Mr. Robertson for his kind remarks, which he promised to pass on to all concerned, and declared the meeting closed. A vote of thanks to the Chairman and the Board terminated the proceedings. THE BORNEO COMPANY, LIMITED. REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS To be presented at the 114th Ordinary General Meeting of the Shareholders to be held at the Company's Ofice, Sackville House. 143-149, Fenchurch Street, Landon, E.C. 3, on Wednesday, 13th October, 1937, at ‘2.30 o'clock p m. The Directors beg to submit the audited Recounts tor the year ended 31st March, 1937. The profit for the year, after making provision for Depreciation The year's working resulted in a satisfactory profit, due to the improvement in Hading conditions during the latter six months of the year, in which all Departments of the Company’s business participated. Teak supplies were well maintained There was a better demand for our timber at higher prices resulting in a small profit on the year's working. The Merchandise business of the Company expanded and good profits were earned in this section. The Tea crop of the Haboko Tea Company, curtailed under the International Tea Restriction Scheme, amounted to 900,568 lbs.. produced at a cost of 6 48d. per lb. The increase in prices for Common Teas enabled the Company ti cover cost and depreciation with a small margin. The Commercial production of Rubber commenced in May, 1936. and up to the end of the financial year .394.440 lbs were produced. The sales of manufactured Rubber, together with the disposal of surplus Quota Rights, resulted iu an excess of revenue over expenditure. It has been decided to transfer from General Reserves the sum of £50.000 towards reducing the amount of the indebtedness of the Haboko Tea Company, Ltd., to this Company. Borneo Motors, Limited, bad another satisfactory year, and a dividend was received from this source. Alexandra Brickworks, Limited, improved its position and earned a profit, which was placed towards reduction of the accumulated deficit in Profit and Loss Account. Dividends on the Preference Shares are in arrears since January, 1932. Mr. A. A. Jamieson retired from the Board on the 31st March. 1937, consequent upon the increased calls upon bis lime from outside sources, and Mr. J. W. Hely-Hntchinsnn joined the Board in his place. In accordance with I he Ariicles, Mr. J K. Henderson and Mr. Hely-Hutcbinson retire and. being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. Messrs. Turquand, Youngs & Co., the retiring Auditors, offer themselves for re-appointment. On behalf of the Board, ADAM B. RITCHIE, Directors. A. WHITWORTH, SACKVILLE HOUSE, 143-149, FENCHURCH STREET, LONDON, E C. 3, 29th September, 1937.
