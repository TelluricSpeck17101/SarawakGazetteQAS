The Sarawak Gazette MONDAY, MARCH 1st. 1937. Local and Personal. FEBRUARY. Her Highness the Ranee, accompanied by Miss F. Mann, her Secretary, sailed for Singapore en route for Japan and the  United States by s.s. Vyner Brooke on February 7th. A large crowd representing all communities assembled to bid farewell to Her Highness, who is going to Hollywood in order  to take part in the direction of a film dealing with Sarawak’s early history. We wish Her Highness an enjoyable  journey and all success with her film venture. It is with great regret that we hear that the visit of the Earl and Countess of Inch¬ cape. which was announced in our last issue, has been unavoidably cancelled. We hope that Lord and Lady Inchcape will be able to visit us next year. The Government bungalow at Santubong, which has for some time past been in a bad state of repair, is now unfit for occupation, and a new bungalow is to be built. In the meantime Government is renting the S.P.G. Mission bungalow, applications to occupy which should be addressed to the Secretariat. In view of the fact that there appears to be an erroneous impression in some quarters that it is difficult to approach His Highness the Rajah, Elis Highness desires it to be made quite clear that he welcomes visits front members of the public who wish to see him. Europeans desiring to interview His High- ness should arrange an appointment with His Highness’ Private Secretary; Natives, Chinese, Indians and other Asiatics are welcome to come to Astana to see His Highness at. any time. اوليه سبب نمفق اد اورڠ٢ برفيكير ساله ياءيت موسه اكن مڠادف سري فدوک دولي يڠمها مليا توان راج, مكدولي توان راج سوک ممبري تاهو دڠن ترڠڽ ياءيت دي مدريماءكن فرلاوتن درفد اورڠ٢ يڠبرحاجت هنداق برجومغا كفدث. اورڠ٢ ايروفه يڠ هنداق برجومغا كغد دولي توان راج ترلبيه دهولو ماهوله برونديڠ دڠن توان فريبيت سكريتري دولي توان راج: انق٢ نݢري, اورڠ چينا, اورڠ اينديا دان لاين٢ بڠسا اورڠ اشيا, مك دتريماء دان دسيلا كاءستات بيلا٢ ماس مهاج بوليه برجومغا كغد دولي توان راج His Highness the Rajah has appointed Mr. E. Parnell to be Government Secretary, and Mr. H. M. Calvert to be Treasurer of Sarawak. We extend our heartiest congra¬ tulations to both officers on their well-deserved promotion. Mr. W. F. Dick, who acted temporarily as Government Secretary after the retirement of Mr. H. B. Crocker, has resumed duty as Resident. First Division, thereby relieving Mr. F. H. Pollard, who was acting in this appointment and who now becomes District Officer, Kuching. Mr. G. F. J. Pegler reverts to his former appointment of Travell¬ ing District Officer. First Division. We understand that Mr. W. S. B. Buck, who is due to return from furlough about the middle of March, will be appointed District Officer, Sibu, and that Mr. R. E. Le Sueur, the present holder of that post, will take over the Secretariat for Native Affairs in Kuching. Owing to Mr. H. M. Calvert's transfer to the Treasury. Mr. R. F. Sinclair and Mr. W. G. Gibson have been appointed to act as Commissioner of Trade and Customs and Shipping Master respectively. It is under¬ stood that Mr. L. D. Kennedy will take over from Mr. Sinclair on his return from fur¬ lough in July. On February 7th Mr. and Mrs. C D. Adams sailed for Europe on furlough prior to retirement. Mr. Adams joined the Sarawak Civil Service in May, 1909, and was posted almost immediately to Baram, where he served continuously for the next thirteen years. Between 1922 and 1928 he filled a number of appointments, acting twice as Resident, Second Division, and once as Divisional Officer, First Division; in 1924 he returned to Baram as District Officer, remaining there until 1926 and thereby bringing his total service in the Baram district up to fifteen years. In 1928 he went to the Coast as Acting Resident, Mukah and Oya, and shortly after¬ wards was transferred to Sibu. When Mr. H. L. Owen retired in January, 1929. Mr. Adams took over the Third Division from him as Acting Resident; he was promoted to Class IA and confirmed as Resident, Third Division, on June 1st, 1929, and apart from six months as Acting Government Secretary in 1933/1934, he continued in this appoint¬ ment. during the remainder of his service. Mr. Adams possessed a thorough knowledge of the natives of the country and a real understanding of their outlook, and by his retirement Government loses the services of an able and experienced administrator. Apart from the official side of his career his departure will be felt in various other spheres, notably in racing circles. ‘C.D.’, as he was always known, was for many years one of the leading lights of the Turf Club, and won numerous trophies with his ponies, the best- known of which was perhaps “Flying Fox” which won the Round-the-Course Race no less than eight times. Mrs. Adams, who arrived in Sarawak in 1931, was a charming hostess who, with her husband, made the hospitality of the Sibu Residency a by-word throughout the length and breadth of Sarawak. She shared to the full Mr. Adams’ enthusiasm for racing, and took a deep interest in native languages and customs. Sho leaves a gap in the social life of Sarawak which it will be hard to fill. We wish both Mr. and Mrs. Adams ‘God Speed and a long and happy retirement. Incidentally, the retirement of Mr. C. D. Adams reduces the rapidly-diminishing band of officers in the Civil Service who served under His Highness the late Rajah to three, namely Messrs. E. Parnell, J . B. Archer, and P. M. Adams. Mr B. J. C. Spurway arrived in Kuching from Sibu on January 29th in order to take over the Forest Department from Mr. T. Corson, who sailed on furlough on February 7th. We wish Mr. and Mrs. Corson an enjoyable leave. Mr. K. L. Whale, of the Sarawak Steam¬ ship Co.. Ltd., left on transfer to Singapore on February 13th. He has been relieved by Mr. D. L. Rothera, who arrived at Kuching on February 1st. Two brides arrived in Sarawak during February, namely Mrs. E. O. Bruce, who passed through Kuching on her way to Miri on February 1st, and Mrs. C. Corbin, who arrived at Kuching with Mr. Corbin on February 22nd. We extend a hearty wel¬ come to both ladies. Visitors to Kuching during February in¬ cluded Major and Mr. S. J. Ennion, the parents of Mrs. B. J. C. Spurway and Mrs. A. L. McLaine, and Graf Francken von Sierstorpff. Graf Sierstorpff, who is the guest of Mr. C. D. Le Gros Clark, left for Sibu on February 22nd with the intention of see¬ ing something of the native life of. the interior. We welcome back Mr. J. B. Simpson, Manager of Dahan Estate, who returned from home leave on February 16th. Advice has been received from R.A.F. Headquarters. Far East, that four R.A.F. flying-boats, which are carrying out a flight from Singapore to Hong Kong and back, will call at Miri, Bintulu and Kuching on the return journey, remaining at Kuching for three days. Air Commodore A.W. Tedder,C.B.,R.A.F., will accompany the flight, which is due to reach Miri on April 5th and Kuching the following day. SUPREME COURT. APPLICATION OF CHINESE CUSTOM AN INTERESTING CASE. KUO LENG GUAN v. KHO ENG GUAN This case, which raises a question of law of con¬ siderable interest and importance, was recently decided in the Supreme Court. The facts are fully stated in the Chief Justice's judgment and may be shortly summarised as follows. The plaintiff and defendant were brothers and were living together in a family establishment. They had a quarrel as a result of which the establishment was broken up. The respective financial positions of the two brothers were different and the plaintiff claimed that by Chinese custom he was entitled to a share of his brother’s property. The Chief Justice gave Judgment as follows The Appellant in this case appeals against a decision of the Resident’s Court, First Division, declaring that by Chinese custom the Respondent is entitled to a share of certain properly belonging to the Appellant. The question raised is one of considerable importance and both the Resident's Court and this Court have been assisted by assessors. I make it clear that if the parlies had agreed that Chinese custom was to apply they would be bound by that agreement. In the absence of such an agreement, however, the question to be decided is by what law the dispute is to be governed. The facts are that the Appellant and Respon¬ dent are brothers. They have lived together since childhood with their father and mother and when the father died in Sarawak in 1921 they continued to live together with their mother. The residence was for the most part in Sarawak, but in 1924 the Appellant and bis mother went to China, the Respondent remaining in Sarawak. The Appel¬ lant and his mother returned to Sarawak in about six months and the joint family residence continued. The fact that the Appellant and his mother went to China and left the Respondent does not appear to be relevant in the present case, but I mention it as part of the history of the case. There appears to be no doubt that a joint family establishment was maintained, though at this distance of time it is difficult to ascertain any accurate details of the financial arrangements. The Respondent said that the household expenses were about $60-$70 per month, and that he paid the most of it. The Appellant says that he also paid a share. The fact appears to be that the two brothers paid their wages to their mother who managed the house. If either brother required money he asked his mother for it. The mother died in 1930 and the two brothers continued to live together. Last October they had a quarrel and in these circumstances the action is brought. If the case is decided on the basis of Chinese custom there appears to be no doubt that the two brothers are entitled to a share of the property though what share is not so clear. The point, however, does not arise as I have come to the conclusion for reasons which I will now state that the contention of the Respon¬ dent that this case should be decided by Chinese custom cannot succeed. The problems involved arc complicated, but for the purposes of this case it may be said that the material legal sources of the law of Sarawak are threefold, viz., (1) Orders and other written laws enacted by or with the authority of His Highness the Rajah; (2)English law in so far as it is not modified by the law comprised in (1) and in so far as it is applicable to Sarawak, having regard to native customs and local conditions; (3) Certain law and custom of races indi¬ genous to Sarawak, including Mohammedan law and other native law or custom in so far as it is reasonable. The law comprised under the third heading includes Mohammedan and Dayak and other customs concerning marriage and inheritance and also certain customs by which criminal sanctions are imposed, e.g., for adultery and incestuous relations as understood by Malay and Dayak custom. The customs of certain other races are also to some extent followed and the question at issue in this case is whether a certain custom of the Chinese is or is not to be admitted as part of the law of Sarawak. This question involves a much wider question which in the absence of any statu¬ tory authority must be dealt with by English law. I do not mean to imply that it follows directly, that English law must be applied when a question of a choice of law arises but that by English law rules are hid down to determine what law must be applied. In white cases these rules are comparatively simple. Thus if an Italian, domiciled in Italy, dies leaving property in England, the English Courts will apply the Italian law of inheritance. On the other hand, if an Englishman, domiciled in England, marries in Italy according to Italian law, his marriage as regards its fundamental validity would be governed by English law, but as regards its form by Italian law. Again, a contract relating to immovable property will ordinarily be governed by the law of the country where the property is situated. in cases of contract relating to movable property and actions in personam, however, the position is different. If, for example, two French¬ men make a contract in London for the sale of a motor car in London that contract unless the parties otherwise agree, is ordinarily governed by the law of England, not by the law of France. The rules on this part of the subject are by no means simple and fortunately it is not necessary to discuss them in detail. The question appears to me to resolve itself into this. The relation between the parties is primarily a relation of contract and as such foreign law does not in my view apply to a case in which the contract was both made and performed in Sarawak where, moreover, the property in dispute is situated. The operation of local custom other than English law is limited first to customs of races indigenous to Sarawak and secondly to those per¬ sonal and family relations such as marriage and inheritance of which by English law the test is the domicile of the individual. The test of domi¬ cile is, however, not exclusive, as in the case of marriage and inheritance the personal law of the individual must also be considered. E.g.. a Hindu may be domiciled in Sarawak but may still rely on the Hindu customs on these matters. To my mind any other decision cannot be supported on principle and, if it were, it would lead to confusion. For example, suppose two Japanese make a contract in Kuching : if the con¬ tention of the Respondent is upheld, this is governed by the law of Japan. How is the law to be proved? Again, an American, domiciled in Chicago, makes a contract in Miri with a native of Labuan. This amounts to a reductio ad absurdum as obviously the laws of Illinois and Labuan cannot both apply. The result is that English law must apply to the facts in the present case, and I therefore allow the appeal with costs. In doing so, however, I should make it clear that I give no decision on the question whether a debt is owing by one party to the other. There may or may not be. and if either party thinks so he is not debarred from bringing a further action. In any such action, however, the rights of each side will be defined by English law. An Account of A Recent Visit to China. ______________________________ BY S. B. AH KOON.—(Continued.) To HANG CHOW. The next day we spent visiting the Horta- Agricultural Park, the Zig-Zag Bridge and the temple, going round the town till ‘2 p.m., when we boarded the train for Hang Chow. Leaving Shanghai at 3 p.m., we arrived at Hung Chow at 7 p.m. On our arrival we went in a tour to the Hang Hui Hotel which faces the West Lake. Early next morning we went out in rickshaws to visit places of interest accompanied by a guide from the hotel. We first visited a temple called the Yellow Dragon cave. The tausu in charge happened to be a Kuala Lumpur man, who had returned to China to become a monk. He showed us round the place, and invited us to his hall, and offered us tea and cakes. We next visited the Monastery of Secluded Light, which is situated on a hill. To reach the temple we had to climb several steps, and on arriving at the top we were nearly breathless. There were not much to see here, so we moved on to another monastery where thousands of fish are to be seen in a large pond inside the temple. It is fun to see the fish, some red, Home white, yellow, black and other sparkling colours. From thence we proceeded to the Lin Yun Monastery. In going from one place to another we had to pass farming land with paths just big enough for one rickshaw to pass. The paths in these rural areas are muddy and uneven, and the rickshaw nearly shook and jolted my inside out. We passed many villages, rice fields, jungle paths and gardens, and also saw the Government Experimental tea plantations. There was a fairly large stretch of land under tea reserved for tea research. Had robbers appeared we would certainly have been carried away for ransom, but thank God there was not a single robber, though this area is not policed. Tigers might be another danger, but fortunately there were none. At the entrance to the Lin Yun Monastery stood big images at least twelve feet high. Eating shops at the entrance were doing a roaring trade, at least at the time when we were taking our lunch; the food served was delicious, and worth the money paid. Thia monastery is the largest of all the Hang Chow monasteries, and idols of famous ancient fighting men (Lo Han) are to be seen. Some 500 of them are housed in one temple, and many other idols in other temples of this monas¬ tery. The cost of a large idol is about $1,000; they are carved out of wood, and good wood, too; a small earthen idol costs about $5. The area of this monastery is about a hundred acres, and there are said to be some 500 monks living in it, making their living out of superstitions people of both sexes, young and old alike, who flock to the monas¬ tery, each one. praying that her or she may be blessed with good fortune. Worshippers from near and far had small yellow bags made of cloth hanging round their shoulders or tied to the sedan chains as a sign they had done or were going to perform their spiritual duty. Superstition among the oversea Chinese is not so deeply-rooted as is the case with the Chinese in China. Our guide informed us that the chief monk is one of the richest men of that place, fearing nothing, either from bandits or corrupt officials. The monastery is immune from destruction, except through natural decay. When the condition of the country is poorer, the better “trade” the monks will have, as then more people will come to worship, to make vows and pray for better luck; and when times are better, more people will come to offer their thanks for the prosperity, so they get it both ways. In some monasteries, Buddha schools are attached whole Buddhism is taught. We also visited the Dragon Well temple, where only eight monks live. The Dragon Well is the place where the famous Loong Chiang Chinese tea came from. The celebrated dragon well is only a little tiny well, round, hardly more than a fathom wide, and about seven feel deep. The water, with some small pretty fishes swimming about in it, is marvellously clear and clean. Though it was showering then, the sight of the water make me thirst for a drink, and I readily stooped down and drank to my satisfaction direct from this famous well. The water tasted so refreshing that had it not been so far away I would surely have brought over a bottle of it to Sarawak. After hearing that we came from Sarawak, the head monk, whose income is chiefly derived from the sale of tea, con¬ ducted us round his temple and also showed us the preparation of tea-leaves. Five women were sorting the leaves, the preparation of which involves three processes of drying and sorting. The chief monk told us that this particular tea could he ordered from him through the post, and he was quite willing to carry out any order which may be sent to him. There are two kinds of dragon-well tea. one from the new and the other from the old well, situated some distance apart from each other and owned by different people. In one day we visited seven monasteries with cults from Buddhism to Taoism, including the temple dedicated to the memory of Gah Hui who was the most famous Chinese of ancient times. Those who are acquainted with Chinese history will inform you how he was put to death, and who his enemies were. Gah Hui's monument and those of his parents and members of his family now stand in a big temple, and those of his enemies are at the entrance to the temple, made of iron, evil looking figures. Great respect is shown to this temple. There is a photographer there who will try his best to tell you all the parti¬ culars of the place; it is needless to say that this is but part of his trading tactics. He speaks in such a polite manner that one does feel inclined to have a photo taken as a souvenir. After having visited some seven monasteries we returned to the hotel tired and wet. As we had left our luggage in Shanghai, we sent our outer clothes to the dhoby to be electrically washed, which was done in the short space of two honrs. Early next morning (11th May) we started off again to visit other monasteries which are situated on the Northern side of the city. The same rick¬ shaw pullers, though we had made no previous arrangements with them, were waiting for us at the hotel entrance. We visited some twelve places and temples of interest. I shall not attempt to describe all of them, but only a few of the more important. The Sui Lok Tung temple has a cave 260 feet in length (Chinese measurement) in which are placed many idols,—here and there and a lamp is necessary to get inside. Some joss sticks were sticking in front of these idols, which showed that worshippers took the trouble to enter this dark cave to pray. Clear water flows out of the eave along the tunnel which leads into it Next is the Ta Yun Si, where some pretty flowers form a very striking background. The bead monk ottered us tea and fruit and showed us round the places where new priests learn intonation, and at last opened his subscription book for us to donate something to the temple fund ; with reluc¬ tance we paid him $5. In the Lee Ann Si we were shown, after pay¬ ment of $2. the precious stone (Poh Choo) It is a tiny pendulum in a small golden hell which is itself in a diminutive pagoda made of pure gold,— or so we were informed. It is locked up in the altar of the main temple. The head monk ordered another priest to take the pagoda out to show us. It would interest many to see how the priest bowed to the pagoda, slowly and reverently, murmuring all the time, took out the pagoda, and with graceful steps brought it over for us to see, putting it high above his head. It is said that the colour of this precious stone appears different to each person’s sight. Our guide first gave his colour as yellow, but both Mr. Lira Tiang Seng and myself saw the same colour, i.e., purple with a dot black. The priest (Monk), explained a lot about the colour. The person who sees rod is said to he the most lucky, for it depends on each person what colour he will see. We were also shown a piece of Sanskrit writing, written on a piece of white bark or rather the leaf of a kind of tree, said to be four thousand years old. "believe it or not," so were we informed by the monk who at the same time was sipping tea with us. The monk there told us many interesting things and treated us as if wo were his old friends. The fee to see the Sanskrit writing above referred to is $1 and one's curiosity is satisfied. Next we visited a pagoda thirteen storeys high, built by Chiew Chiaw a few hundreds years ago. Next the Hu Pau Temple was visited. The water from the spring here is so clear that we were con¬ strained to drink it. We also saw the bed of the Living Buddha, known otherwise as Aa Hoot; the bed-room is said to he that used by the Buddha when he was living some centuries ago. In my opinion this is only one of the money-making tactics of the monks so as to get some coppers from the visitors. The bedding and curtains, the table, in fact all the other furniture in the room is quite new and is probably not more than a couple of years old. Indeed, it is only a model showing what the Living Buddha’s room looked like when he was still alive, and kept as a memory of him through years of tradition. Many people, some of whom were Europeans, visited the temple when we were there. Return¬ ing in the afternoon, we went boating in the West Lake, and visited all the places of interest in this lake. There are many pleasure boats for hire, some paddled by the fair sex, but the majority by men who make if their profession. All boats arc licensed, the fee being $10 a year, and numbered. Not being a writer, as 1 have already mentioned, I am unable to describe, to my great regret, the beautiful scenery of this famous lake; the lake is natural, but many parts have been bridged and some alterations have been made to add to its natural beauty. Writings of famous ancient men can be seen everywhere. The gentle fragrant breeze and the ripple of the crystal water of the shallow lake makes existence in this drab world seems worth while for the time being, and the gorgeous natural scenery on which our eyes feasted with undiminishing pleasure is balm for the con¬ flict of daily life. Everything there has a legend or a history attached to it, and your guide will explain to you any questions you may wish to ask him. The guide is supposed to be supplied by the hotel, but his transport is defrayed by the visitor; and of course he expects a tip. The Chung San public park, The Liu Villa, The Kok Village and the town itself face the lake, which is so wide that a boat will take a whole day to circumnavigate it. On the 12th at 8 a.m. we went out to see the Museum, which was opened at 9 a.m. This museum includes a zoo and a forest experimental plantation. and minerals and other ancient articles are also to be found there. Some curiosities like a sheep with two bodies, eight feet, but only one head, and a mummified corpse, excavated during road-making and kept in a glass receptacle, are among the many exhibits in the museum. Live specimens of plants with their botanical names in Latin and Chinese may be seen in the compound. From here we went to the centre of the town where business is fairly brisk. Talking of business, the selling of young deer-horns is most interesting. A herd of deers of about 100 head is kept in a large shop-house, and their young horns while still soft are trimmed off for sale at good price. These deer are small and spotted, not like the big deer in this country. Each is kept in its own enclosure, the inside of which is far from clean. Hang Chow is a model town, and sanitation is well observed by the pedestrians so far as one could see. Smoking in public is forbidden, and we were politely approached by a policeman on duty and asked not to smoke in the street. Spitting is not tolerated at all, and pedestrians will have to see that their coats are properly buttoned. All these things are only forbidden on the public roads, and anyone who wishes to smoke cigarettes can enjoy them to his heart’s content in bis own house or in the shops. BACK TO SHANGHAI. At 1.0 p.m. we came to the station, after having our return tickets "chopped” we went to the plat¬ form to wait for the train for Shanghai. Leaving Hang Chow at 2.0 p.m., we arrived at Shanghai at 7.0 p.m. that evening. Dinner over, we spent our time in reading the newspapers, from which wo learnt about the passenger air service in China, and decided to fly to Nanking. On the 13th, we filled in and signed declaration forms for purchasing our air tickets from Shanghai to Nanking at $25 each. We sent, our luggage by train to Nanking. In the afternoon we spent our time in motor-car rides, sight-seeing in the town, and also went to the museum which, we were informed, was not yet completed and was therefore shut to the public. We went to the famous Shanghai Stadium, but the entrances were closed, so we only had an outside view. We then went to see Mr. Wang’s private park, this park, though private property, and a part of the compound of (he residency of Mr. Wang, is open to the general public. There arc many things to see in here, in fact it is far better and contains more things of interest than the Chung San Park in Hang Chow. We visited the Great World at night Unlike its namesake in Singapore, this Great World com- prises houses several storeys high. There is little to see here, but there was a wayang in every other room. From here we went to the cinema hall, where a fairly good talky was being shown to a large and appreciative audience. To NANKING BY AIR. On the 14th we got up at 5 a.m., rang for our breakfast, which we swallowed rather in a hurry, and picking some odds and ends of our stuffs, we drove to the Lung Hua Aerodrome, where we arrived at 6.15 a.m. Though we were early some passengers had already arrived there before us. Those who were so unlucky as to be too fat were weighed, although the passenger’s weight was declared in the prescribed form. By 6.55 a.m. the gate to the aerodrome was opened and we all were shepherded      into      the        aeroplane    "Cheng     Tu,"    and we took our seats by the side of each other. This aeroplane is a 14-seater, and there were eleven passengers in all including three ladies, one of whom was a Chinese. The engine started sharp at 7 a.m., and after about five minutes running on the landing-ground she rose, and soon Shanghai city was left behind. It was very fine riding in the air and we enjoyed it very much indeed, indeed we were only too sorry that she arrived at Nanking so soon. When the plane was in the air the steward went round and asked each passenger, in pigeon English, how he or she wished the chair to be adjusted, and several times during the 75 minutes’ flight he came round to ask if the chair needed fastening or required adjustment; he also brought round chewing-gum, and cotton wool to protect the ears from the noise of the plane. The steward, the embodiment of politeness, stood at the back of the aeroplane looking to the comfort of the passengers, many of whom were fast asleep. One European passenger became air sick and vomited, and the steward jumped to him, taking away the discharge in a paper receptacle which was provided, and bringing water in a glass for him to wash his mouth. We enjoyed the trip and spent most of out time looking far away at towns, villages, and padi fields. The train below seemed to be like snail crawling, though it was running at least 25 miles an hour. The aeroplane did not toss, but jerked a little occasionally. At 8.15 a.m. we landed on the. aerodrome in Nanking. Only three passengers landed here. The clerk in the station asked whether we required a car, and when we answered in the affirmative, he telephoned for one which soon arrived. We drove straight to the Tung Nan Hotel in Hsiakuan. In the afternoon we went to the railway station to fetch our luggage, and afterwards we went out for a ride in a motor-car. We visited the Chung San Mausoleum, the Tan Van Kai memorial Hall. The Ming Tomb and the Chung San Park. UNDER A CLOUD TN PENGPU. We left Nanking early in the morning by train for Pengpu town, which is situated in the An Hui Province. Tickets were purchased in the Nanking substation by die river bank, aud we went across the Yang Tse Kiang to Pukow by. steamer. The train left Pukow, station at 9.45 a.m. and we had our lunch in the train, and by 3 p.m. arrived Pengpu. an old style town. After the inspection of our luggage by plain-clothes men in the station, and having answered a few questions, we went in rickshaws to the Chio Tung Hotel and stayed in a large room which had two beds in it but no modem comforts. Soon the hotel people came to inspect our passports. At 5 p.m. Police Officers also Arrived for the same purpose, and asked various questions, minutely taking down in writing our answers. They took about half an hour to finish, after which they bowed and departed, murmuring apologies for the trouble and inconvenience caused. At 8 p.m. a plain clothes man who had a badge pinned to his coat troubled us with the same questions and examination of our passports. This man did not know, or rather bad never heard of Sarawak, and amused himself by saying "Is not Salawok' a Japanese possession, or something to do with Japan?" Our Certificates of Identity did not convince him. but my Long Service Decoration had the effect of making him change his mind, although outwardly by his looks he pretended that he did not believe it. This man asked several ignorant questions, and our firm answers or rather retorts soon made him leave. Shortly after his departure, two soldiers armed with revolvers came into our room to inspect our passports and luggage and asked a few questions. This sort of unnecessary fuss began to get on our nerves, and I did not even sit up to answer their questions. I wanted to pour the contents of my travelling bag out on the floor for their exami¬ nation. but as soon as I opened it one of the soldiers politely said that il was all right and, he did not want to see any further, and left us with apologies. On account of these examinations we were unable to go out, and so remained in the hotel until we left Pengpu early next morning. We rang for the hotel servant and asked why we were subjected to this sort of examination as if we were criminals. He said that we were suspected to be Koreans in the employ of Japan, and the officers were from the Peace Preservation detachment. The Detective Branch, and the Mili¬ tary Command. Apparently they were counter¬ espionage officers. Well, that was that, and we were lucky not to be kept behind bars. To TSINAN—CAPITAL OF SHANTUNG. PROVINCE. Early next morning we said good-bye to Pengpu and bought second-class tickets for Tsinan, the provincial capital of Shantung, at $16 each. Fukien bank notes are not legal tender here, so we had to change our notes to Government bank notes at ten per cent, discount. At 6.15 a.m. we left Pengpu station for Tsinan. Our compartment had four berths, and we had our breakfast and lunch in the train. We passed through station after station, village after village, and town after town. All the farmers were busy on their farms, helped by their dumb comrades, the buffaloes; there were hills, but not even grass grew on them, and the river beds were dry with a stagnant pool of water here and there in the deeper places. Food, tea, and other beverages could be obtained on the train, but the prices charged were not cheap. Our lunch (European food) cost us $3.30. A Japanese trader was with us in the same com¬ partment, and he spoke such good Mandarin that we did not know his nationality until he disclosed it. He gave us a lot of information about faci¬ lities for travelling to Japan via Manchuria. The train glided on and passengers, at various stations, disembarked and embarked Japanes Military Officers in full uniform, and Chinese men with their foreign Asiatic wives were but a few of the groups of passengers. The wife, in one case which attracted our attention, spoke Chinese to the husband and some foreign dialect to her son, and the father spoke Chinese to his wife and son. but the son used his mother's dialect to his parents. Tsinan was reached, and by 8 p.m. we found ourselves in the Guest House of the China Travel Service. Our room was well ventilated, clean, and had two snug beds, with reading lamps attached and good furniture. It cost us $4 a night, but I think it was worth it. Besides the comfortable room, I must not forget to mention the politeness of the servants, who were not allowed to receive tips, as they are paid on monthly salary. They gave us every satisfaction. Vices like gambling and prostitution are forbidden in this hotel, and therefore it is a real rest-house for those who require quietness. Though there were numerous lodgers, the quietness was only broken by the cry of children. Not only were the rooms comfortably furnished, but the baths, the closet, etc., were the lust word in cleanliness and comfort. On the 18th we went out in a motor-car for sight-seeing, and drove round the town. The places we visited were the Museum, Pau Tu Chuan, Hek Fu Chuan. We also went round the city wall to the Thousand Buddha hill, which can¬ not be reached by car, and sedan chairs had to be used. At Fu Chuan we drank the clear and refreshing water spouting out from the mouth of the stone tigers. Just in front of this was a small pavilion in the centre of a small stream, and our guide told us that this was the place where the white and black snakes, in ancient Chinese legend, .  flooded the temple known as Kim San Si. Even now during high tide this pavilion cannot be flooded. It is not for us to believe what he said, but this is exactly what we were told. The roads in Tsinan cannot be said to be very modern, but many are now being repaired. The museum collec¬ tion consisted chiefly of models of hospitals, of famous battles, of farms, of the Colosseum and other ancient buildings, animals, etc., but what drew the attentions of the crowds was a small living crocodile. TIENTSIN. We bought our tickets for Tientsin and left for that city on the 19th early in the morning. After passing the Huang Ho River (known as the Sorrow of China') the land along the railway line consists of a large plain in which farms are every¬ where. There is no land vacant except the hills, if any. Tea and milk were not obtainable in this train,—we could only get the usual Chinese makan. Tientsin was reached after an uneventful journey, at 5 p.m. and the train stopped at the Eastern Station. If a passenger disembarks at the West or North Stations, he has to travel another eight miles to Tientsin town. As else¬ where, various hotel people greeted us, and we went to the Chung Koh Hotel, situated in the foreign concession. We had a nice dinner, and the celebrated Tientsin liquor is so fine and tempting that even a teetotaler like myself was hired to taste it. On the 20th we went round the town in a motor¬ car. The Public Parks. Pei Ning and Chung San, were visited. Although it was 12 noon at that time it felt like 6 p in. in Sarawak, only there was strong wind blowing. We took a man from the hotel as our quide and he gave all the information we asked (to be continued.) Hollywood Beckons. The Other Day, as is my wont, I took myself to one of those third-run movie houses where for fifteen cents I saw two features, one newsreel, two prevues, three shorts, and a couple necking in the seats in front of me. Of course, the pictures were very old, but then- we can’t have everything—the couple was young. Now I have no objection to a movie being old, still for fifteen cents I’m entitled to a gentleman's protest when every film I see is as alike as a pair of bookends. It is apparent that what Hollywood needs is a producer with imagina¬ tion. with freshness, with courage. And lest you say that such a man is not to be found, I am thinking of myself. All my life I’ve wanted to be a motion picture producer. I have already served my apprenticeship in a defunct haberdashery busi- ness. and now I am prepared to startle the world, and am use. myself perhaps, with the unique movies I plan to make. Here is a sample schedule : Production No. 1—My first effort will he a foot¬ ball picture. The star halfback of Old Siwash (Mother of Men) is kidnapped by gamblers on the eve of the big game. Dawn breaks and no sign of the halfback. The game starts and still no sign of the halfback. Then, in the last quarter, with the score 6-0 against them and only five minutes left to play, the coach, the girl, and the crippled pal decide to look for him. They find the boy, hijack him from the gamblers, and rush him back to the stadium where five men hustle him into a uniform. He speeds onto the field amidst the cheers of a hundred thousand people, gives his name to the referee, dons his helmet, and is just about to call the signal when—you guessed it—the whistle blows, the game is over, and the score is still 6-0. Production No. 2—My second tidbit will be a backstage story. An hour before the curtain is about to go up on "The Big Gold-Diggers of 1937,” the leading lady sprains her brain. Our hero, who is the song-writer of the show, interpleads for our heroine, who, until this time, has been biding her light behind a bushel in the back row of the chorus. He begs the producer to give Ruby a chance, "Please, Mr. Shlotz, she knows all the songs, she’s memorized the lines, and don’t forget, the show must go on Well, the producer agrees to let our heroine play the part, which she does. And, as a fitting climax, the show flops with a thud heard round the world, and little Ruby proves to all and sundry that she is, in the parlance of Broadway, "stinkaroo." Production No. 3—No picture schedule would be complete without a gangster movie. For this attrac¬ tion, I have aspirations of signing James Cagney. In the very first reel Jimmy’s life is threatened by rival gangsters for muscling in on their territory, and in the second reel, I’ll be a three-horned rhinoceros if the boys don't carry out their threat, and knock Jimmy off. This, of course, makes for an exceedingly short movie, but I, for one, think it's worth it. Production No. 4—I’ve even got a title for this epic. It is called "Back to Nature, or with Tom Rover on the Albany Night Boat." The plot con¬ cerns a sophisticated millionaire playboy who, tiring of the night clubs, dry gin, and the superficiality of the metropolis, flees to a small village in Vermont. There, he meets a beautiful simple farm girl, and is treated to a week of sleeping under the stars, milk¬ ing cows, and rising at the crack of dawn. These marvels of nature make, not only a new man out of him, but also a very disgusted one, so back he bolts for his old philandering haunts—and the girl with him! Production No. 5—Then, too. I must produce a picture for the Shirley Temple fans. A rich, middle-aged, childless couple, having heard that no home is a home without the patter of a youngster’s footsteps, decide to adopt a small girl from an orphan asylum. The kid promptly proceeds to bring a little sunshine into their drab lives, She keeps jumping up and down off their laps, leading stray dogs into the house, and kissing them with jam smeared all over her lips. With such endearments. she establishes herself as being so confoundedly cute that, in the last scene, the old hoy, in a mad frenzy, is observed stuffing the sweet child up the fireplace.—FRITZ MALINA in Judge. H.M.S. “Falmouth” in Sarawak Waters. VISIT OF THE COMMANDER TN CHIEF. CHINA STATION. During the last few days of January H.M.S. Falmouth, flying the flag of His Excellency Vice- Admiral Sir Charles Little, K.C.B.. R.N.. Naval Commander-in-Chief, China Station, visited Miri, Kuala Rejang, and Kuching. The Commander-in- Chief and Lady Little arrived at Miri on January 28th. having motored from Kuala Belait, and inspected the oilfields anil refinery. On January 29th H.M.S. Falmouth left for Kuala Rejang, arriv¬ ing early on the morning of the 30th, and anchoring off Rejang village. Later Mr. J. B. Archer, Resi¬ dent, Third Division, accompanied by the District Officers, Sibu and Lower Rejang, paid a call on His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief which was returned on board s.l. Chamois. H.M.S. Falmouth then proceeded as far up river as Gunong Ayer, Admiral and Lady Little transferring to s.l. Chamois in which they went on to Sarikei: they returned to H.M.S. Falmouth the same evening. H.M.S. Falmouth reached Pending at 3 p.m. on January 31st. She was met on arrival by Mr. A. W. D. Brooke and His Highness the Rajah’s Aide-de-Camp, who had travelled to Pending in H.H.M.Y. Maimuna. which was used to transport Admiral and Lady Little and the officers of His Excellency’s staff to Kuching. As the Maimuna passed Fort Margherita a salute of fifteen guns was fired from the Fort battery. The Maimuna then anchored opposite Astana and was hoarded by Mr. W. F. Dick, Acting Govern¬ ment Secretary, and Mr. E. Purnell, Treasurer of Sarawak, who took Admiral and Lady Little ashore in the Siamese State Barge. After inspecting a Constabulary guard of honour which was drawn up on Astana lawn, His Excellency was received by His Highness the Rajah, who wel¬ comed him in the presence of a gathering of a number of senior officers and heads of various communities. Tn the evening a dinner, followed by a dance, was given at Astana for the Commander-in-Chief and officers of H.M.S. Falmouth. Thirty petty officers and ratings were entertained in the Rest House and the Sylvia Cinema by courtesy of His Highness the Rajah. On the following evening a most enjoyable dinner party, which was attended by Their Highnesses the Rajah and Ranee, the Astana party and about six other guests, was given on board H.M.S. Falmouth, which sailed for Singapore at 8 a.m. on February 2nd. During their visit to Kuching Admiral and Lady Little were the guests of Their Highnesses the Rajah and Ranee at Astana. Their visit was greatly appreciated, and it is regretted that the navy can only find time to come to Sarawak at such rare intervals. Films of the Month. JANUARY AND FEBRUARY. The bill of fare at the Sylvia Cinema during the past two months was varied enough to suit all tastes, since it ranged from H. G. Wells’ vision of the future through drama and light comedy to musical extravaganzas and song-and-dance shows, with one or two Wild West pictures and Tarzan thrown in for good measure. Artists included Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Ronald Colman, Robert Montgomery, Gigli, Wallace Beery, Jessie Matthews, Sonnie Hale. Joan Crawford and Ray- mond Massey. The combination in The Shape of Things to Come of Britain's finest imaginative writer and her most imaginative producer promised great things, and this promise was fulfiilled. H. G. Wells and Alexander Korda are an ideal team for a picture of this nature. which more than lived up to expectations. The story relates the progress of a war which ends Western civilisation and plunges the world into chaos from which it is rescued after many years by a group of practical idealists who succeed in bringing about Mr. Wells’ dream of a world state. It is a mighty theme and it was handled with a fitting grandeur. The opening sequence showing the outbreak of war was magnificent, and one which the leading politicians of every country should be forced by law to see every morning and evening of their lives. We were shown ‘Everytown’ on the eve of war, and the producer captured admirably the happy-go- lucky "It can’t happen here" atmosphere which, in spite of the complacency of the ordinary citizen, was threaded with a sinister counterpoint of ten¬ sion and distrust. The sudden outbreak of war was very well done; the air raid scenes were strikingly realistic, some of the stills being almost unbearably poignant. After the first smashing blows of the war came the long period of devastation and despair in which what was left of humanity huddled together in the ruins of towns and villages, still senselessly fight- ing, until dispersed by the advent of the 'wandering sickness.’ This part of the film was enlivened by the splendid acting of Ralph Richard¬ son as the pinchbeck Dictator rallying his ragged and starving subjects with all the rubbishy clap- trap with which we are already uneasily familiar. His portrayal of ‘‘the Boss" was first-rate satire, and this film will not, we fancy, be shown in Rome or Berlin, Laughter is the bully's most deadly enemy, as Messrs. Adolf and Benito are very well aware. The last part of the picture, though a triumph of production, was somehow not quite so satisfying. After half-an-hour of the aseptic palaces of glass and chromium in which our descendants of 2060 will live, one longed to take off one's boots in the back parlour of a thoroughly unhygienic seaside boarding house, put one’s feet up on a horse-hair sofa, swill guinness out of a bottle, belch, bombard the aspidistra with shrimps’ heads, and read aloud the racing news to a blowsy landlady with three squalling children. In spite of this, however, Things to Come was a land-mark in British film production. Raymond Massey was excellent as John Cabal, the man who re-organized the world, but the acting honours must go to Ralph Richardson. The supporting cast, which included Sir Cedric Hardwicke. in a small part, was uniformly strong. Top Hat, long and eagerly awaited, was a first- rate musical comedy starring those delightful artists Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The tunes, already familiar from the wireless and gramophone records, were uniformly catchy with¬ out perhaps reaching the level of these in Roberta. the last film in which this couple appeared, and one missed . the singing of Irene Dunn. But. Roberta set an exceptionally high standard, and comparisons are perhaps a trifle unfair. Top Hat was excellent entertainment, the singing and particularly the dancing being quite m the first rank; the usual musical comedy misunderstanding was exploited with more than ordinary skill, and the acting was good throughout. Particularly worthy of mention are Edward Everett Horton. who is an admirable foil for Fred Astaire, Eric Blore, who out-Jeeved Jeeves as a supervalet. and Erik Rhodes, who has a particular flair for port¬ raying (let us be really insular) the smoother and more oily type of dago. He was the professional co-respondent in Gay Divorcee, and gave a very effective performance this time as Alberto, an Italian dress designer. A splendid all round show. Eric Blore appeared again as a valet in Picca¬ dilly Jim, a light comedy starring Robert Mont¬ gomery and that excellent actor Frank Morgan. The latter is always a joy to watch, a particularly effective trick of his being his time-lag in the appreciation of a ticklish situation; it is a delight to watch him cut short a vacuously hearty laugh with a startled ‘‘oh—ah—er—” and a sudden reali¬ sation that the position is not quite so funny as he imagined. In A Message to Garcia a mediocre story was redeemed by the splendid acting of Wallace Beery who had a part after his own heart as a drink-sodden white renegade in the Caribbean. The plot concerned the Spanish-American war. and Beery was superb as the unwashed scoundrel who had sold bad ammunition to, and spied for, both sides impartially. John Boles was adequate as the hero entrusted to carry a message from the President of the United States to the Insurgent General, Barbara Stanwyck made an attractive heroine, and Alan Hale gave a good performance as Dr. Krug, the counter-espionage expert, but it was Beery's film. Other pictures worthy of mention are First a Girl, with Jessie Matthews and Sonnie Hale, a musical comedy that was not quite up to standard; The Man Who Broke The Bank of Monte Carlo, remarkable for some good acting on the part of Ronald Colman; No More Ladies, featuring Robert Montgomery, Joan Crawford, Charles Ruggles, Franchot Tone and Reginald Denny; Forget Me Not, which was made by Beniamino Gigli’s magnificent singing; Rumba with George Raft and Carole Lombard; and last but by no means last, Tarzan The Ape Man, with Johnny Weismuller in the name part. A thoroughly satis¬ factory two months for local film-fans. First Division News. JANUARY. Forty-eight civil and fifty-three criminal cases came before the Kuching Courts during January. Of the latter, twenty-nine were for breaches of Municipal by-laws. During January the Travelling District Officer visited villages at Merdang Gayam, Merdang Lumut, Bayor Ulu and Bayor Plaii, Santubong, Bako, Sungei Mas, Salak, Mersan, Sungei Batu and Semariang from the 4th to the 10th. At Merdang Gayam, Merdang Lumut, Bayor Ulu and Bayor Plaii, no definite code of adat for the Dayak inhabitants appears to exist, and where fines have been imposed it was found that no degree of uniformity had been achieved. A meeting which was attended by all the Tua Kam pongs, including Orang Kaya Jumat of Lundu, was called with the least possible delay, and with the assistance of Native Officer Abang Zamhari a comprehensive list of Fines and Customs was com¬ piled. A very enjoyable regatta was held at Kuching on January 2nd. Large crowds lined each side of the river to witness the keenly-contested races, and as no bad weather occurred to mar the proceedings, the spectators spent a pleasant day. The course presented a colourful and attractive picture, not the least of the attract ions being the bright-hued costumes of the natives. , • Boals of all shapes, sizes and colours plied up and down the river but in no way impeded the racing Adding to the pleasure of the actual racing was the presence of the Constabulary hand, which played selections throughout the day from a floating band- stand. Comedy was not absent, for spectators on the South side of the river were vastly entertained by the efforts of aspirants to traverse the length of the greasy pole. Further and frequent laughter was caused by those unlucky crews whose boats quite involuntarily acted not as racing finals but as submarines. Fear and trepidation was roused at the alarming angle at which the s.s. Circe listed while alongside the wharf due to the throng of spectators who utilized the vessel as a grand-stand. Their Highnesses the Rajah and Ranee enter¬ tained guests on board H.H.M.Y. Maimuna. which was moored close to Pengkalan Sapi. The Regatta Committee, whose, unremitting efforts provided excellent entertainment. are to be congra¬ tulated. Dahan Rubber Estates, Ltd., harvested 24,300 lbs. of dry rubber during January. Rainfall at Bau was 13.98 inches and at Dahan 14.35 inches. The Bau Municipal Board met once during January and decided the rates for 1937. The question of motor taxation was again brought up. and the Board was informed that the matter . was still under consideration. All taxis and buses were inspected by the Kuching Inspector and his assistant. Many "Heath Robinson" contrivances were dis¬ closed, and condemned, much to the indignation of the owners, many of whom regard a brake as an unnecessary item of equipment fitted to keep Municipal authority happy, rather than as a life- and-death matter on narrow roads. The Dresser paid his monthly visit to Simunjan at the lull moon and the dispensary was crowded for two days with Dayaks wanting N.A.B. injections. The Chinese have applied for a dresser to be stationed permanently in Simunjan, as they say that the eight days visit of the Dresser once a month is not enough. They are willing to do without street lighting if their request is granted. A Dayak from Krosen fell from a durian tree while picking fruit and was seriously injured, a sharp bamboo penetrating his stomach. He was brought to Serian where the Dresser performed an operation, but the patient died three days later from peritonitis. The padi all over the Serian district is good, especially in the Samarahan and at Simunjan. Sonic of the hill padi in the ulu Simunjan and ulu Sadong is being harvested, and it is expected that the swamp padi will be ready at the end of the During the month there were many verbal appli¬ cations by Sebuyow Dayaks near Simunjan for land tor coconut planting. All were told to wait till their applications had been first inspected by a Native Officer. A further application for l00 aqres of land by five Bugis for coconut planting near Trasi, Kuala Sadong, was approved. Major W. F. N. Bridges visited Simunjan from January 23rd to 24th during which time inspection of Chinese-owned rubber gardens at Simunjan and near the colliery were made. Dayak gardens in the Batang Simunjan and Malay gardens at Gedong were also visited. Padi in the Lundu District is reported to be better than last year, and a good harvest is expected.

Falmouth on the Medical Recreation Club ground. The visitors, with an almost entirely new side to the one that visited Kuching in 1935, provided a much stronger opposition than expected, and a narrow win for the home team by three goals to two was generally considered a fair result on the run of the play. The first half proved goalless, principally on account of the erratic shooting of the Kuching forwards on the one band, and good goalkeeping on the part of the Falmouth's goalkeeper on the other. Had the home forwards been capable of turning to good account a few of the many excellent opportunities for scoring that came their way they might well have established a substantial lead by the interval. At the other end of the field the Kuching defence was little troubled; both backs and goal¬ keeper easily breaking up anything attempted by the visitors’ forwards. Following the interval exchanges became faster and more even; the Falmouth's forwards finding the harder ground after the change of ends more to their liking. A few minutes after, the restart M. Juan gave Kuching the lead but the Falmouth equalised almost immediately. Song Chiang then scored for Kuching but his goal was disallowed. Both goals now came under pressure before M. Juan put Kuching ahead again. The Falmouth were still playing strongly, however, and drew level for a second time within the space of a few minutes. For the remainder of the game it was touch and go which side would obtain the deciding goal until M. Juan clinched matters for Kuching by com¬ pleting a "hat trick" a few minutes before the end ; his low oblique shot from far out giving the visitors’ goalkeeper little chance to save. Referee : W. H.

Cutfield, Acting Resident, Second Division:— "The District Officer, Betong, has again been kept busy during the month in the investigation of a theft of $6,000 from a Lower Saribas Bandong which was wrecked off Sebuyow. The Chinese have themselves to thunk for transmitting such large sums of money in charge of the Chinchu, but it is difficult for them to obtain thc- money by any other means. If they apply for Telegraphic Transfers at Pusa or Debak the Court Writers in these stations are unable to pay them as insufficient cash is carried, and all balances are forwarded to Betong at the end of each month. "In this instance the money from various Towkays in Kuching was handl'd to the Chinchu for delivery to certain shopkeepers at Pusa and Debak. The Bandong was wrecked, or partly wrecked, off Sebuyow. The Chinchu presumably embezzled the $6,000 and deposited it in a bag at Maludam. He himself proceeded to Debak where he was arrested and made a voluntary statement to the Court Writer and Village Constable admitting the embezzlement, but unfortunately no particulars were taken. Again unfortunately on his way to Betong under arrest he managed to jump over¬ board and commit suicide. “The difficulty is now in discriminating which is stolen money, and which the legitimate money of the Sebuyow Chinese, as the bag was found empty. It is also difficult to decide who had a hand in the theft besides the Chinchu, and to what extent they were implicated. "It is difficult, to know what steps the Chinese can take to ensure the safe arrival of their money in small outstations.’’ "At Lubok Antu ex-Penghulu Ramba and his brothers and followers were found guilty of a breach of the tuba fishing regulations and duly fined. "They refused to pay the line, deposit pledges, open an appeal or come to Lubok Antu or Simanggang to discuss the matter amicably. The time given them in which to settle their fines, had not expired at the end of the month, but failing any response they will have to be dealt with. Their attitude is not appreciated by the majority of up-river Dayaks." The District Officer, Simanggang, reports that ten Seduru Batang Ai Dayaks were fined $1.00 each and costs for settling a fruit tree dispute by cock-fighting without obtaining permission from Government first. The fines and costs were all paid at the end of the month. — In the Resident's Court, Simanggang, Sampurai anak Manchu, Dayak of Sebuyow. was sentenced to six months R.I. and ordered to pay $100 Pati Nyawa (Blood money) for causing the death of Dau anak Jawa of Rumah Jabu, Sebuyow. by the negligent use of his pig trap. A second case also happened at Sebuyow where Blon anak Banggan voluntarily caused grievous hurt to one Runggu anak Kunchit by a dangerous weapon; the accused was sentenced to three years R.I. and was ordered to pay compensation $50 to the complainant, and also to pay his medical charges. At the end of the month the Chinese vegetable gardener from Enteban, Skrang, reported that the Dayaks were taking no further interest in their plots, which they have now abandoned. He therefore tendered his resignation, which was accepted. During the month Major W. F. N. Bridges arrived at Simanggang in order to look into matters concerning rubber restriction in the Second Division. On January 31st he left for Engkilili via the Ulu Undup accompanied by the District Officer. There has been a marked rise of prices on all commodities in Second Division bazaars. On January 26th Mr. R. W. Hammond arrived at Simannggang to survey the educational position in the Second Division. On the 28th he proceeded to Sebuyow accompanied by the District Officer; they returned to Lingga on the 29th, and Mr. Hammond proceeded to Banting accompanied by N.O. Wan Mahadar to visit the S.P.G. School, from there on to Penghulu Linang’s house to inspect the Dayak village school, and then on to the school at Rumah Jali Abok. The District Officer. Saribas, states that at the commencement of the tapping holiday large crowds of Dayaks arrived in Betong bazaar. So far only three applications have been received for relief work, and it is not anticipated that such appli¬ cations will be numerous. At the end of the month Dayaks commenced clearing the Simanggang road. Reports were received that the school-master’s house st St. Christopher's Mission, Debak, was destroyed by fire on the 7th. The building was empty at the time, the pupils being on holiday. It is unlikely that the outbreak could have been caused accidentally, but so far the Police are in possession of no clue as to the perpetrator of the crime. Padi in the Lubok Antu district appears good, and if the recent high floods have not done damage there should be a good harvest in the Ulu Ai. At the end of the month Saratok bazaar was alive with upriver Dayaks who came down to sell their rubber; judging by the money drawn by the Chinese, it must have been a record output. The opportunity was taken of discussing the question of repairing the Debak Road with Pengarah Nyalu, Penghulu Undom and leading Tuai Rumah. They all agreed to bring down their anembiak three days before the Regatta next month and carry out the necessary repairs. The application for a sago factory at N. Demit above Saratok was filed after the consent of the Malays to surrender the land had been obtained; it should give employment to a number of persons, and the Chinese owner intends to mill padi and saw timber over slack periods. A case of attempted suicide by a Krian Dayak was heard at Saratok during the month. The Dayak, after becoming very intoxicated. on his farm, returned to sleep off the effects in his house. Unfortunately he woke up and saw his son pulling out tail feathers from his prize fighting-cock. After assaulting his son the inebriate, filled, with remorse, donned his best clothes, lay down in his room and decided to end his life by taking tuba. SIMANGGANG REGATTA. FEBRUARY 6TH, 1937. A successful Regatta was held at Simanggang On the 6th February, 1937. Copies of the programme were printed about a month in advance. By the 5th February morning streets and bazaars were crowded and many langkaus (sheds) appeared on the vicinity of the bazaar and near the bank of the river adjoining the Government Wharf which were for officials, spectators and coffee-shop keepers, etc. By the noon of the 5th all the District Officers of the various Districts of the Division were present in the station. Major Bridges and Mr. R. W. Hammond were also at the station on duty. Various Native Officers. Court Writers and Peng- hulus were also present. The chabut undi had been conducted by the Resident on the 5th evening at Fort Alice before a large crowd of owners and paddlers of boats. Advantage of this opportunity was taken by the Resident to explain the rules and regulations governing the regatta to the owners and paddlers of boats who were very much pleased. On this evening the bazaar was congested and it was not surprising to see a gradual rise in prices of foodstuffs. But there was nothing short in the bazaar and unusually on this date two buffaloes were slaughtered and sold in public which meant that everyone of two houses had fresh meat on this day, which undoubtedly helped the vigour of the populace who had to face a very straining sport. Racing boats were anchored from Tanjong Pasir Panas to Kampong Ilir side. The 5th night was very clear, which conveniently assisted the visitors to cook their meals wherever they liked. The Regatta Eve at Simanggang is an event which should not have been missed. On this evening the m.l. Betty arrived from Kuching for the tour of Major Bridges, which ship added to the beauty of the Government Wharf by the milkish while clean vessel lying side by side with m.l. Rentis which resembles a sister ship to Betty. Well, there came the 6th February, 1937, a day for which every person of Simanggang if not from the whole of the Division was eagerly waiting; after the dawn, the sun with its rays faced without any shy or screen like a light in the lighthouse viewed to a ship reaching a port from a distance on the beginning of a clear and comfortable night. At 7.30 a.m. boats were ready and officials were collected in the launches and langkaus for their various duties. Behind the langkau of the Judges on the des- rending slope of the Fort Alice hill was covered with spectators most of whom were the opposite sex and ninety and nine per cent, of them were in their teens, facing the morning sun and eagerly watching the opening race. On an occasion like this, the sightseers eyes looked clear and innocent as a lotus pool on the morning of a bright day. The Races were started in ideal weather con¬ ditions. Including the Consolation there were 12 Races, and excluding the Consolation there were 185 entries All the Races except Race No. 5 and Consolation had cash and cup prizes which obtained 1st place, and also cash prizes which obtained 2nd and 3rd places. The Cash prizes were considerably higher than if not doable to previous years' prizes. RESULTS OF RACES. RACE NO. 1,—1st Choba Choba. 2nd Lautan Bara. 3rd Chaya Tanjong Mambang Laut.

RACE NO. 12.—Consolation. 1st Seri Belalang. 2nd Belalang Mewan. 3rd Seri Baya. 4th Seri Melawan. 5th Belalang Bijat. By 5 p.m. the Races were completed and the Judges, Umpires, Starters, Clerk of the Course and others were assembled in the Judges langkau and on the request of the Resident Mr. R. W. Hammond kindly distributed the prizes. At the end 3 cheers were given for the success of the Regatta. Senang Hati, as it is, easily came first in two Races (Race No. 7 and in the Champion Cup Race No. 91 and cash prize cheerfully she got amounting to $90 excluding the cups. The crews of this easily-winning boat consisted of men from Sebuyow and Kabong who are famous seamen on these coasts. The fortunate owner of this gifted boat is the Schoolmaster of Betong. Sepawi bin Ismail, whose home town is Simang- gang. Another lucky boat was Chaya Tanjong Mam¬ bang Laut of Sebuyow. She came 3rd in the 1st Race, 1st in 3rd and 11th Races. As above, the crews of this boat also were from Sebuyow and Kabong. No doubt as her name she will be a well-known boat to Simanggang Regatta as a light¬ house is well-known to navigators. Race No. 5 was open to school boys, and there had only been two entries of 8 paddlers each. The paddlers were all less than 16 years, and it was interesting to witness that this Race had an exciting finish; as the boats were nearing the winning post, it appeared that Sekolah Abang Aing was going to overtake St. Luke’s, and there were some justified and cheerful shouting "come on St. Luke's—come on Abang Aing.—hurry up!” but Reverend Stonton of St. Luke’s justifiably reserved himself who was acting for a Judge, but alas! when the result was known the Reverend rightly gave a smile. One of the crew of this boat was the Senior Native Officer Abang Zin’s son, who received the prize card from a Judge. The Choba Choba, which came in first in the first Race, is owned by the Officer-in-Charge of Saratok, and everyone is glad for not disappointing the crew of such a boat for coming such a way off. In fact, all the substation visitors got something good for their respective stations on their return owing to the sweepstake. All concerned in this affair bad a keen interest to secure a successful result of this complicated function which eventually obtained, and which had not only to depend on the kind co-operation and assistance of everybody but also the laws of nature. It is hoped that the two distinguished visitors mentioned above will not forget their presence in this magnificent land on this memorable day. Sincere thanks are due to all concerned for the admiration of this task, and wish year after year hear the same with more and more prosperous results.—Contributed. Third Division News. JANUARY. At Sibu one Coroner's inquest was held into the death of a clerk employed on s.s. Kampar who was drowned while this vessel was in port. It appears that this man returned to the ship from the bazaar late at night in an intoxicated condition; he fell overboard and was drowned. A verdict of death by misadventure was recorded to which a rider was added stating that no blame or negligence attached to the officers or crew of the vessel. The total land revenue collected in the Third Division during December amounted to $11,615.20 compared with $14,747.56 during December, 1935. The net Divisional revenue for 1936 is $118,681.95 which is disappointing, being about $13,500 (subject to cheek) below the estimate, which it appears was unduly optimistic. The final results are. however, better than at one time seemed possible. A Malay named Utoi was badly mauled by a crocodile while collecting mushrooms at S. Metai. It is surprising that he should have met with a crocodile in this vicinity, as the Metai at this point is a very small stream and a considerable distance from the main river. Luckily Utoi was accom¬ panied at the time by his brother, who helped him to escape. Utoi, after treatment at the Sibu Hospital, has now recovered. Owing to the high price of rubber all sections of the community at Sibu are enjoying considerable prosperity. The cost of labour is very high, and on the small rubber gardens coolies demand as much as three-fifths share of the rubber produced as wages. Prices in the bazaar are soaring, and such commodities as vegetables and fish are often scarce, the demand being much greater than the supply. Many Dayaks have prospered either by tapping their own rubber or working as coolies, but many of them spend their money rapidly on cheap and useless articles from the bazaar. On January 9th Penghulu Briak, of the Katibas, died at the reputed age of 63, a great loss to Govern¬ ment He proceeded to Sibu for the Regatta but immediately entered hospital with a severe attack of malaria; on showing slight improvement he ran away from hospital in the early hours of the morning and died three days after reaching his house in the ulu Katibas. Briak, with his younger brother Sirai, lived in the same house and ran the Katibas jointly. They worked together in amazing unison and never quarrelled, and were often mistakenly called twins. They possessed great kuasa authority and were rightly "kings" of the Katibas river. Briak was due to receive the Long Service Decoration this year, having joined with Sirai as a policeman in November. 1916, and having been created penghulu in 1926. Sirai will now run the whole district on his own. Reports show that good crops prevail throughout the ulu Rejang. The Kayans have almost finished harvesting, but Kapit and Song districts are just about to begin. Attempts are made continually to impress on the natives the folly of putting all their eggs in one basket as regards padi, but it is up-hill work. Owing to the failure of jungle fruit, pigs are causing great damage to padi at Kapit, and many when killed are so thin as to be hardily fit for food. The result has been an enormous demand for cartridges. Penghulu Ansi reported that wild cattle were causing much damage to some of the Pala Wong padi. The District Officer, Meluan, states that hill padi is reported to be good in all districts, but the damage done by pig, although the grain has not yet formed, is in excess of that hitherto experienced. All Dayaks have therefore been permitted to live in their farms till harvest is over. Swamp padi is good with a few exceptions where a total loss is reported. The communal padi farm at Rumah Empam has been saved owing to the timely visit of Mr. Ong Kee Hui of the Agricultural Department. The Dayaks followed his advice and washed the stalks free of mud and let out the stagnant water, and with the help of heavy rain which fell soon after, a little over three-quarters of the whole was saved, and is looking most promising. Mr. Ong Kee Hui was in the Meluan District from January 7th till 10th. He brought rat and pig poison with him and explained its use, made a rentis for the Agricultural Demonstration garden, and visited Empam’s padi farm. He and the District Officer made a tour of smoke-houses and inspected rubber in the bazaar with a view to encouraging dealers to insist on an even higher standard of rubber from Dayak pro¬ ducers, and to persuade them to smoke sheet rubber for a longer period. Health in the Meluan District was fair during January. No further deaths from pneumonia were reported, but six deaths from gastric influenza occurred in the Melurun. The dresser was sent, and the epidemic arrested. An unpleasant accident occurred at Balingian on January 17th. A village constable (Mahali) and two coolies were in a boat in the ulu Balingian warning the public about the impending tapping holiday; a crocodile suddenly appeared and snatched the steersman, Eda bin Bakar la coolie), from the boat, which sank at once. Thu village constable with commendable courage grabbed the arm of Eda and was dragged about under water for some time still hanging on. He was obliged to let go eventually, and the unfortunate coolie's body was recovered later, badly mutilated. V. C. Mahali is being recommended for the Bravery Medal. * ~ ~ An inquiry under the Lunacy Order was held at Dalat on the report of two Melanau women that their uncle was insane. The investigation failed to disclose any evidence of insanity. The only evidence forthcoming was that the alleged lunatic, now an old man, bad never married, and that he had had a violent quarrel with his nieces the ’previous day. The two women were warned against making idle reports of this nature. The dresser visited Oya twice during January. There was a slight outbreak of influenza at Dalat, but apart from this general health was satisfactory. Seas were calm on the coast during the greater part of the month and the Melanau fishing boats went out regularly. The people of the Oya district appear to be very contented and prosperous, and few of them have cause to come to the Government offices. The present high price of sago is encouraging the Melanaus to increase their holdings, and many applications for sago-land were received at the Dalat land office. The price of raw sago rose to the high price of 95 cents at Dalat and $1.06 at the Kut. The exports of raw sago were :— Dalat is now very prosperous, and bazaar shop- houses, though small, command rents up to $30 a month. The District Officer, Lower Rejang, remarks that an unsatisfactory feature of the tapping holiday system of restriction is the swamping of both office and bazaar by very large numbers of Dayaks who would normally come down in small parties throughout the year. As it is, the rush on the first few days of the tapping holiday deprives the Dayaks of the undivided attention of officers which they would otherwise obtain. Accompanied by Native Officer, Abang Openg, Mr. Jacks visited the Lemanak Dayaks under the control of Penghulu Giman and the Layar Dayaks in Penghulu Sli's district from 18th to 22nd. Twenty houses were visited and there was nothing of any importance brought before them. On January 23rd H.M. Ships Decoy, Defender, Rainbow and Regent arrived at Rejang and anchored off the village. The first two named are destroyers, and the latter two submarines. This is believed to be the largest concentration of naval units ever assembled in a Sarawak river. A party of seven officers, including Commander A. F. de Salis, R.N., Senior Officer of H.M. Ships in Company, visited Sarikei, where they spent two nights. A visit was paid to a Dayak house in the ulu Sarikei; apparently this was a unique experience for the visitors who appeared to be as much enter¬ tained by their Dayak hosts as the latter were by the presence of such a large number of Europeans in their house. About fifty natives and others, mostly Rejang Melanaus, were shown over H.M.S. Decoy and the submarine Rainbow by courtesy of Commander de Salis. On January 30th H.M.S. Falmouth, flying the flag of Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Little. K.C.B.. R.N., Naval Commander-in-Chief. China Station, arrived at Rejang and anchored off the village. The Resident, accompanied by the District Officers of Sibu and Lower Rejang. paid an official call on His Excellency aboard H.M.S. Falmouth. The war¬ ship then proceeded up the Rejang and anchored at Gunong Ayer. His Excellency and Lady Little and party visited Sarikei for a few hours, proceeding to and from H.M.S. Falmouth in s.l. Chamois. The Falmouth left for the Sarawak River early on the 31st. The Island Club. FAREWELL DINNER TO MR. AND MRS. C. D. ADAMS. A gaily be-flagged and flood-lit Island Club was graced on February 3rd by the last of the many farewell dinners given in honour of Mr. and Mrs. C. D. Adams. Attended by thirty-one Europeans, many of whom had travelled considerable distances to be present, the dinner was an unqualified success. The handsome Bill of Fare inlaid with the familiar green and red racing colours of the retiring Resident was one of the many small touches which helped to mark the evening as one of the most enjoyable spent in Sibu for many years. Many speeches, coherent and otherwise, were made before the ladies (to whom the assembled company’s thanks are due for their aid in ordering and preparing a magnificent dinner) and their cavaliers moved through to the annex to enjoy themselves with less strenuous exercises—a vigorous game of Rugby football was instituted—which came to an abrupt end when the ball (The Resident’s Cushion of State) was unfortunately eviscerated during a loose scrum. Songs, ancient and modem, were sung with a fervour until early morning when the cheerful party broke up. The loss of a sound administrator and a great gentleman and that of his very charming lady is deeply regretted.—(Contributed.) Fourth Division News. JANUARY. The District Officer, Miri, visited Sibuti and Niah from January 14th to 20th. Natives, for the most part, are busy on their farms. Enquiries are being made as to the whereabouts of T.K. Andam who left his house in the Niah two years ago and has so far failed to return. The Sekolah Anchi at Miri has been removed from its original site in order to make room for the New Government Offices, and meanwhile the school is housed in the Malay Court. H.M.S. Falmouth arrived at Miri from Brunei on January 28th. On the same day His Excellency Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Little, K.C.B., R.N., Naval Commander-in-Chief, China Station, who was accompanied by Lady Little and a small party, arrived overland from Brunei. H.M.S. Falmouth left for Rejang and Kuching on 29th. The District Officer, Baram, reports that all natives are now on their farms gathering the harvest which appears, from various reports, to be a reason¬ ably good one. There are of course many complaints of pests, the most troublesome, apparently, being pigs, since owing to the wide-spread search for food last year very few people had the time or the inclina¬ tion to make fences round their farms of sufficient strength. The present Mohamedan burial ground below Kampong Narum at Baram is gradually being washed away, and it has already been necessary to move many of the graves. A new site above flood level has been found and surveyed, and, at the request of the Native Officers and the Mosque officials, orders have been issued forbidding any more burials on the old site. All the Dayak beadmen from the Bakong river were called to Marudi on January 16th and informed of the appointment of Penghulu Gerang as their new chief in place of Rhu who resigned last year. Visitors to Baram station during the month included the Rev. Father Jansen, Messrs. C. J. Cook and W. H. Doughty from Kuala Bakong, and Messrs. H. C. Shrubsole and W. O. A. McNeice from Singapore. Heavy imports were recorded at Limbang during the month, due probably to Chinese New Year. At Limbang a Chinese by name Chee Lee received a bad wound when the ladder on which he was standing collecting sireh leaves collapsed, and in falling he ripped open the calf of his leg on a projecting nail. InA the absence of the dresser, the District Officer washed the wound and having bound it up sent him immediately to Brunei, where the doctor put in eleven stitches; the man is now well on the way to recovery. The Officer-in-Charge, Lawas, reports that all was normal in his district during January apart from a plague of ants. The invaders seem to have concentrated on the Fort more vigorously than else¬ where, and the occupants find it impossible at present to obtain an undisturbed night's rest. Penghulu Lakai of Lawas, who was suspected of keeping for himself the proceeds of various fines he had imposed, was interrogated and stated that he only kept fine monies until the particular fine was paid in full; he then—and only then—informed the authorities that a case had been settled, and so-and-so fined, at the same time paying in the total fine collected. When he was called to the fort to be ques¬ tioned on this matter he conveniently remembered to bring with him the total amount of seven fines which he had imposed in the course of the last six months, and which he said had only just been paid to him. It is true that Muruts can only pay their fines in driblets, and there is no harm in a Penghulu keeping these driblets until such time as the total fine is paid, but Penghulu Lakai lives only three hours' away from the fort, and is continually com¬ ing into the office, and yet he had never even mentioned that he had decided any cases in the course of the past six months, let alone imposed or collected any fines. He has now been instructed to report every time he visits the fort on any case that he has settled since his previous visit. Roughly 2,500 piculs of rubber were exported free of cess from the Lawas District during the first part of the month. The Lawas Estates, Ltd. alone exported 65,854 lbs. of rubber during the month, three times as much as their normal monthly exports. The padi at Bintulu appears to be ripening rather earlier this year than usual. By the end of January quite a number of Dayak houses had started to harvest their crops. A large amount of damar was brought down to the bazaar by natives during the mouth, and a good price was obtained. Jelutong and sago prices are still good, and the natives generally are making good money on this account. The Bintulu sawmills are working all out, and there is therefore a demand for logs. On his return from Tatau the District Officer, Bintulu, inspected the building of the new sawmill belonging to the Ming Hin Kongsi. This mill is being built with the idea of supplying hardwoods for China market, it is yet to be seen how this mill intends to export the wood as no ship over 6' draft can get into the Tatau river safely. Trade during the month has been booming at Bintulu; all vessels leaving the port have been full, and the cargo was too much for s.s. Auby. The Kim Chin Seng has been taking most of the Kuching cargoes.
