   THE S. s. Kuching arrived from Singapore on the 20th. instant. Her passengers included Messrs. G. MacBryan, Adams, Cutfield. Chapman, W. H. Smith, Thring and Miss Turing.
    
   THE s. s. Kuching sailed for Singapore on 24th. instant. Among her passengers Messrs. W. V. D. Skrine, E. S. Holl, Mr. and Mrs. Larkin and child.
   
   THE p. s. Adeh arrived from Miri on the 30th. instant. Passengers Dr. C. ,Hose, Messrs. F. H. Kortright and Coley.
   
   THE night of the 28th. June marked a great event in the Annals of the history of the Railway namely the running of the first night passenger train. The train which leaves Kuching at nine o’clock each night has been started for the convenience of both Kuching up-line people who find the day trains in sufficient. It enables those up the line, after possibly working hard all day, to come into Kuching by the evening train, enjoy its attractions and return up the line by the night train. In a similar manner, it enables those employed in Kuching, but with interests in the form of gardens, etc. up the line to go up the four-fifteen train and return to Kuching the same night, after using up all the surplus energy which has been stored during the day.
   Such an advance makes us wonder if any of us will live to see the Cross-Country night mail leave Kuching at midnight to arrive "at, I ', Banjermassin at day-break the morning of the day after next.

150	THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, JULY 1, 1920.
P. H. O’NIANS,
General Manager, S. G. R.
    IT is an interesting fact that a couple of rabbits may, at the end of ten years, have produced a family reaching the phenomenal number of seventy millions. (Rats).
    ABOUT 98% of the water consumers of Cincinnati were metered on Dec. 1. Two years ago orders were given that meters must be installed on all unmetered taps by the close of 1919. Since then about 16,000 meters have been set, leaving about 1,000 more to be placed. Consumers pay the first and maintenance costs of meters. The meter rate is now 12c. per 100 cu. ft , regardless of the quantity used. There has been a 50% advance in the meter rate within a year or two.
    SEASONING wood quickly by kiln drying is an important matter in many wood-using industries, but the United States Forest Products Laboratory finds that few kiln operators attain the fastest safe rate of drying, and that quick satisfactory drying depends more on the operator than on the kiln. It is found within the limit of commercial possibility for 1-in. lumber to be kiln-dried from 18% moisture content (as reached in three months’ yard seasoning) to 5% moisture and conditioned for use in 5 to 7 days for bard maple and birch, 6 to 8 days for red gum. walnut and mahogany, and 8 to 10 days for plain sawed oak.
    ENCOURAGING, indeed, is the news that comes from Belgium regarding its industrial recovery. In a recent booklet on the subject D. L. Blount, recently Director-General of the Central Office of Information, Ministry of Economics of Belgium, places the following estimates of resumption of industry; Coal mines, 94 cent normal ; refined sugar, 100 per cent; cotton spindles in operation, 75 per cent: cotton looms, 60 per cent; wool products, 75 per cent; shoes, 70 per cent; window glass. 34 per cent; plate glass, 36 per cent: steel mills, 30 per cent, while 12 blast furnaces are now producing 10 per cent of the output of the 54 blast furnaces in operation before the war. Of the machinery taken away during German occupation, 5,069 pieces out of 9,797 have been recovered. The agricultural production in 1919 surpassed the average for the years just preceding the war, the yield of wheat, oats, barley, and rye having been particularly good. In the light of the unfavorable reports current in the newspapers regarding conditions abroad, this showing of Belgium is very encouraging. It warrants the hope that a return to normal will not be as long deferred as we have been led to expect.
    WE are authorized by His Highness the Rajah to state that any officers who can be spared from their duties in the outstations may take leave to visit Kuching from the 25th. July next to the 5th. August. H. H. Y. Zahora will call at the Coast Stations between
the 20th. and 25th. of July for the convenience of officers who wish to come to Kuching. 

   THE Simanggang Regatta will take place on the 5th. and 6th. August. Further particulars will be given at a later date.

   The above donation of $283.26, is made up of small sums ranging from a few cents upwards and a list of the juvenile subscribers in a handsomely bound book containing the signatures of those who’ were able to write has been presented to the Dayang Elizabeth, second daughter of H. H. the Rajah, in the absence of His Highness’ eldest daughter.
   Another book is going round and will, we understand, be handed later to the Dayang Valerie together with the donations.
   The following letter has been received by Miss Cubitt addressed to “ The Children of Sarawak".

Astana, 26th. June, 1920.

Dear “Children of Sarawak,”
   I have to thank you all for the generous way you have subscribed to the Rajah Charles Brooke Memorial Fund, and for the very handsome book of signatures which you presented me.
   I shall often think of you all when I am far away in England, and the book will lie a memento of the many little friends 1 leave behind in Sarawak.
		Yours Sincerely,
ELIZABETH of Sarawak.

OYA.
—?—
May
   I arrived here on the 4th. instant, and took over charge of the station from Mr. J. B. Archer, who, after visiting Dalat and handing over, left on the 6th. for Sibu by the s. l. Chamois.
   Court.—During the month few cases of importance came up for settlement.
   Wee Ah Hong, alias Law Thai Choon, attempted to abscond via Miri in p. s. Adeh from Oya. under advances from Sibu and Oya amounting to $4,000 more or less. He was. however, promptly returned from Miri and is now awaiting his trial.
   Lunggang, ex-prison cook, was sentenced to one dozen with the rotan and an extra six months R. I. for stealing rice from Government and attempting to sell it in the local bazaar, at less than the regulated price.
   
   P. W. D —The whitewashing and tarring of all government buildings is now completed, except at Dalat, where the bungalow, police quarters and chief clerk’s house remain temporarily untouched owing to the supply of whitewash being exhausted, none being procurable in the vicinity. Work on the new telephone wire between Mukah and Dalat has been progressing steadily, but is at present suspended, three miles short of the latter place, the remaining lengths of wire, No. 12 gauge, not being yet forthcoming from Kuching. The bazaar shop owners both at Oya and Dalat have also finished their repainting and hot for a few delapidated buildings, now undergoing either repair or demolition, both localities present a distinctly cleaner appearance.
   The gang of ten prisoners front Oya put in a good week’s work cleaning up the Dalat station, which, owing to scarcity of labour there, had naturally become somewhat overgrown. Two prisoners remain to keep in check the undergrowth on the paths, which re-appears everywhere with alarming rapidity. As a result of little over a mouth's growth it took 500 kampong men two days to deal with the babas in the bungalow compound alone.
   The sandy roads in Oya, however, are in a very good state.
   Prisoners here have also been employed in renovating the Government temui preparatory to my visit to the ulu after Hari Raya. The Government bandong, which has now been generally overhauled, repainted and greatly improved, also the cattle and boat sheds.
   Twenty new posts have been placed over the bar marking the channel entrance. Owing to the action of the tides, and nature of the bed. they are difficult to plant securely.
   Food Control---200 bags Saigon rice arrived from Kuching on the 16th. On checking over the weights I find that a very appreciable quantity is lost through the evident rough handling received at the hands of coolies armed with iron books. Excluding sweepings recovered, and an allowance for normal wear and tear of gunnies, in this consignment, I cannot account for at least twenty gantangs, practically one sackful, representing $32.
   The amount sold totalled 1,375 gantangs. 
   The price of hen’s eggs is now uniformly fixed at 5 cents each throughout this division.

   Ten schooners and four steamers entered, while ten schooners and four steamers cleared.
   General.—On the 16th. per p. s. Adeh Mr. Whittaker passed through en route for the Wireless Station at Miri.
   On the same day, Kitang, daughter of Pangiran Mohamat, Senior N. O., was married amid great festivities, to Awang Skrah, brother of Awang Mohamat of the local Police Force.
   The body of a crocodile 12 feet long was found floating a short distance upriver, it was shot while swimming opposite the Oya Court house landing stage, having come from the river bank bordering the cattle ground. During the last week of the month large shoals of bilis were reported off the kuala. Everyone who could procure a boat of any description was out daily and rewarded with huge catches within a few hours. As a result the local neighbourhood is carpeted with drying fish, much to the delight of all, who are packing and stacking as fast as they can.
   I visited Dalat with Mr. Archer on the 4th. for one day to take over, and again on the 22nd. remaining until the end of the month. While there I definitely-fixed an area to be used solely as a Milano grave-yard, as hitherto these people have been in the unhappy habit of planting their dead in any spot, even underneath their houses. Three prisoners, temporarily working there, the second night of their arrival successfully levered up a small floor plank in their cell and got out about 8 p. m. However, within two hours they were all recaptured and duly chastised.

   The balance of coal in stock at the end of the month was 571 tons.
   Sales at Labuan amounted to 1,018 tons, practically all of which was taken by Messrs, the Straits Steamship Company’s steamers. 
   Good progress was made in the main drivage of the North Drive mine and we shall soon be able to open out a new level.
   An accident occurred in one of the out-crop workings. resulting I regret to say, in the death of one of the Chinese coolies. The accident was caused through a barrier of coal collapsing and the unfortunate coolie being precipitated into the old un-ventilated workings below where he would, soon lie suffocated with gas. Every effort was made at rescue, but owing to the large volume of choke damp coming up from the old workings, it was impossible to get the body out until some eight hours later.
   The usual work of cleaning boilers and overhauling of machinery was done in the beginning of the month and everything went smoothly in this department.
   Thu s. l. L’Aubaines boiler was cleaned and engine overhauled. One of the lighters was also beach-
   
ed for repairs and was still under repairs at the end of the month.

   We beg to announce that we have recently been appointed Sole Agents in Sarawak, Brunei and British North Borneo for Messrs. Joseph Travers & Sons, Limited, proprietors of the well-known “SHIP” and “SIGNAL” brands of TINNED PROVISIONS and are now ready to commence business on wholesale lines.
   It is still impossible to obtain adequate supplies from England and the Colonies but the situation becomes easier week by week and we hope shortly to be able to meet all demands.
   We shall be pleased to send price lists on application.
