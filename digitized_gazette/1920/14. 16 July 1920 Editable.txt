  THE s. s. Kuching sailed for Singapore on the l5th instant. Passengers by her were Messrs. T. A. Robarts, E. Beng Hian, Kazuo Ito, Law Bin, Mrs. Chirk, Miss. Clark, Mrs. Teo Soo Ann and Nyonya T. Nam Kiaw.
  THE s. s. Alice Lorraine sailed for Sibu, Mukah mouth and Bintulu on the 10th. instant with passenger Revd, F. A. Mulder for Mukah.
  THERE has arisen of late a burning question, for to judge from remarks heard in many quarters, flames and those undying ones, should be the portion for such as are responsible for the present state of affairs. We refer to the constant dearth of soda water, ginger beer and other necessities of civilized life in the salubrious island of Borneo. Things have indeed come to a pretty pass when the prospect of a sodaless Race week is no idle Action. Two dark and seemingly contradictory rumours have reached us the first to the effect that the local agents of The Mineral water manufacturers of the East are in the black books of the said Firm and consequently that supplies are cut off; the second to the effect that 12 cases of soda water ordered by the Sarawak Club three weeks ago are yet to seek, the said Firm refusing to supply them. Is it that Kuching credit has sunk to such a low ebb as these rumours imply, or is it some dastardly attempt on the part of the Firm to reach some vile ends of their own by heaping up suffering on a hitherto too long suffering public ? We attempt no solution of the problem, but Lupe that anyone who can in any way influence the I cargo of the Kuching on its next return voyage from Singapore will do his best to solve the problem in the only way acceptable to the white inhabitants of Borneo.
  
Sarawak Club Race Week.
   In addition to the usual Tennis, Golf and Bowls Tournaments it is hoped on one evening to give a combined dance and impromptu concert.
   Mr. Davis Evans of Sadong who won the Derby Sweep  has expressed a willingness to put up a cup for Golf to be played off during the week.
  
The New Club.
   A general meeting was held at the above club on Friday the 9th. instant, when a new committee was elected, consisting of Mrs. Small, Miss Tait, Messrs. C. Fenwick, O. Lang and G. B. Stooke (Hon. Sec.).
   An interesting resolution was passed amending the Club Rules with regard to tennis. Two courts are in play and it is now possible for a previously arranged "four" to engage the gravel court on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
   It was also decided to hold an American tennis tournament during Race Week. Those wishing to participate are requested to send in their names as soon as possible. The lady members of the club are combining to give a dance we have no details hut from what we bear, it seems to be a function organised on the most cheery lines.

“His Lordship.”

   A planter of our ( Straits Echo ) acquaintance who was on friendly terms with the head of the Church of England in Malaya and did not quite know how to address him when writing to him solved the problem to his own entire satisfaction by starting his letters “ Dear Bish!” There have been many others out here who at one time and another have wondered whether the Bishop of Singapore and his brothers of Sarawak and Rumtifoo should properly be styled “My Lords.” Perhaps the following dicta from an expert which show that the address is permissible though not compulsory will set the doubts at rest.
   “There is a difference between a Bishop in partibus and it diocesan bishop in all Catholic countries; and although in France, for instance both are addressed as “ Monseigneur " to the latter only is reserved the title of “ Sa Grandeur."
   " In the Church of England the Lords Bishops do homage to the Sovereign on their consecration in respect of their temporalities, and by this act the become eligible to take their seats as Lords or Peers of Parliament.
   “ Neither Colonial nor Suffragan Bishops go through this formality, and their assumption of the distinction of being addressed as “ My Lord ” is merely one of those harmless weaknesses from which even Bishops in partibus or elsewhere are not exempt.
   “I am old enough to remember when "the returned empties,” as the retired Colonial Bishops were irreverently called, whilst content to be announced to preach in this country as “ the Bishop of So and So," were greatly pleased to be addressed by their servants and parishioners as “ My Lord," and as their weakness harmed no one and caused many to smile, it was passed by without protest."
   The yearly examinations at St Joseph’s School as usual started July 1st. and were over by July 8th. on which date at 4.30 p. m. the prizes were distributed. Father Haidegger gave a short report of the school, he said, that 154 boys took part in the examinations of which number 85 were boarders, that nearly 80 per cent passed, showing that masters and boys had done their duty. He further said that the conduct of the boys as a whole has been good.
The prizes were then given away by the Very Rev.
Monsignor Dunn the following boys were the winners.

  Two prizes were given fur religious instruction and Bible History and were gained in the Upper Classes by Jin Lam and the Lower Classes by James Koo.
After the distribution Monsignor Dunn said that he was pleased to hear that the examinations and conduct of the boys had been very satisfactory. He exhorted the boys to perform all their duties through their whole life conscientiously and do their best to show by their life, that the education they have received is a credit to themselves and to the school. He wished them a good time during their holidays which will last till August 1st.

   There has been comparatively little Court work during the month. A number of petty thefts have been reported to the police, but the thieves have not been traced.
   A Malay from Puak was fined for doctoring Javanese coolies, and another Malay living up the left-hand branch was warned for interfering with Dayaks in a similar manner.
   A Chinese was brought down from Pengkallan Ampat on a charge of stealing fowls. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment, and to a further term for being at P. Ampat after having been expressly forbidden to return to that place. He had formerly been convicted of selling gun-powder to Dayaks.
   A number of Chinese domestic quarrels were before the Court, some of them being referred to the Chinese Court.
   A Kheh Chinese was fined for stealing, and making a meal of, his neighbour's dog.
   One of the Court peons was dismissed for misappropriation. A Malay attacked a Chinese clerk whom he found in his room on his return from work in the evening. The latter had a narrow escape, the weapon used by the Malay flying off the hilt. The Chinese got away with a slight cut of the head.
   The Malay subsequently took proceedings against his wife and the Chinese, and the usual fines were imposed.
   A Chinese boy was drowned at Bidi in an old working 1 understand that a number of accidents have occurred at the same spot, and have now had a fence erected along the side of the road. Another case of drowning was reported from Buso, a small child falling into a well near the house during the absence of its parents.
   The Government house at P. Ampat has been demolished and is being rebuilt across river.
   A good deal of Dayak revenue has been paid in  during the month.
   The prison gangs have been raising the Seringgok Road, and cleaning the roads round the station.

SADONG.
June.

On the 7th I left by s. l. Mermaid for Kuching.
On the 11th. accompanied by T. K. Sudin of Muara Tuang I left Kuching to visit the Samarahan district. We reached the pengkallan of the Nissa Shokai Rubber Estate at 4 p. m. Here I was kindly entertained by the Manager, Mr. Oseki and was shown over as much of the estate as time would permit.
	The following morning I was busy attending, to Debt Court work, and signing on tappers, and other labour for the estate. We left at 2 p. m. and arrived at Dungun at 6 p.m. This place only consists of four Malay houses, and is situate about half way between Muara Bahru and Muara Bukar.
The 13th. was spent visiting the Chinese gardens adjacent to this place, there are quite a number of would-be gardeners here, who have all managed to acquire a piece of Dayak land, but the majority of the gardens did not justify the presence of these Chinese, who are mostly run-aways from the Japanese estate, and I have no doubt from other places. They live in a wretched way, only plant up a very small patch of kribang, and steal or beg their living from the Dayaks.
I arrested two who bad no possible excuse for being there. The Dayaks brought in one a few days later but three more escaped me.
With few exceptions, these Chinese should be turned out of. this place, it is only a rendevous for bad characters. The Dayaks will do nothing without a surat prentah, and simply allow their fowls, padi and land to be stolen without a word of protest.
On the 14th. 1 visited the village of Bahru spending the night there. On the following day we walked on to Munggo Babi : this is quite a large village, and has been practically rebuilt lately.
Complaints were made of the Lanchang Dayaks concerning land boundaries, but no cases were brought forward.
On the 16th. I returned via Panchur on the S. Bukar, and thence to the launch.

SIMANNGANG.
   I returned to Kuching on the 17th., and on the 22nd. to Sadong.
   There was a fair accumulation of Court work on my return. Three cases of incest, a case of theft from the gambling farm, and in connection with it a case against the police for keeping some of the money recovered from the thief.
   On the 29th I visited Gedong to elect a new Tuah Kampong to take the place of Abdul Gapar who died last, month. His son-in-law Sumsudin was chosen by the people to be Tuah Kampong.
   The opium, gambling and arrack farm changed hands and at midnight on the 30th. the new supplies were handed over to the new fanner and the surplus supplies of the old farm were placed in the Court, to be handed over later.
   Ten thousand dollars in notes were received from the Sarawak Treasury, for the purpose of paying wages at the Government Colliery.
   Eight steamers and seven schooners entered and cleared the port during the month.	.

HENRY H. KORTRIGHT,
District Officer. 
May.
    Having settled the remaining cases at Saratok on the 1st., I left for Kabong on the 2nd., stopping at Kupang where Court was held in the Titan Kampong’s house. Kueh Gan Peng was fined $50 for breach of Food Control Regulations as regards the price of imported rice. Haji Odon was fined $100 for bringing a false accusation against the integrity of the Native Officer of Saratok and local Tuahs. This ease had come up before me at Saratok on four occasions, originating in a charge against three women in Haji Odon's house for misappropriation of a number of sarongs left there by an Indian trader. The case had been fully investigated by the Native Officer of Saratok, Abang Abutalip, at the time the charge was originally made in February, and adjourned by him for settlement on the next visit of an officer to the station. Haji Odon however felt called on to accuse the Native Officer of having written down different evidence to that given, and the Tuaks of giving false information in support of the Indian trader, thereby making a most serious matter of what was a comparatively trivial case—Haji Odon’s allegations having been clearly disproved, and the Native Officers minutes of the evidence taken previously being corroborated in every instance, he was dealt with as above, and the three women concerned in the original charge also lined. Kabong was reached at 8.15 p. m. Court was held there on the next four days, a number of cases being settled. Tan Ah Lok of Roban was sentenced to three months for assault, and ordered to put in a pledge of $250 if he wishes to return there on release. This man is one of the few remaining members of the kongsi against whom certain measures were taken last year, the others having for the most part taken themselves off to the Sarih and Sarikei districts. Ngui Ah Jee was arrested at 1 bus for harbouring the escaped prisoner Kim Tong Cheng, alias Ah Maw, mentioned in last month’s report. The latter was also captured by P. Engkamat, but the same evening again managed to escape from the Dayak house where he had been taken preparatory to being brought down to Kabong. He has not been seen since, but it is suspected he is in the Sarih or Sarikei district, and P. C. Bujang Mos has not yet returned from there. As a result
of further evidence in the charge brought by one Jaoyah (f) against her husband Klan, and one Chua Beng Tek, this case was heard in camera, and on the 5th. was adjourned, the minutes being forwarded to His Highness the Rajah and the accused released on bail of $500 and $1,000 respectively. I left Kabong for Lingga on the 7th. At the same lime $6,250 was remitted to the Simanggang Treasury. Owing to a storm, we had to put into S. Batu for the night, and Lingga was not reached till the next day. I returned to Simanggang on the 9th after disposing of a few unimportant cases. Mr. Dick reported that prisoner Voon Shak sent here from Kuching to serve his sentence of 15 years in March, escaped from the Ranger mandor's gang on the 5th. The Dayaks had all been warned of the man's escape. I at once sent police to Lingga and Sebuyow with the man’s photograph to warn the police there, and to catch up and search all vessels which had left since the man’s escape. At the same time, the Supt. of Prisons was advised. The man had not been recaptured at the end of the month, but certain, reports from Sabu led one to think he may after all still be in this district, and every effort is being made to effect, his arrest. On the 10th. I was approached by the principal Chinese with regard to the stocks of native rice in the bazaar. Having appointed a committee to discuss this, it was decided on the 11th. that Government would buy up all stocks in the bazaar at 60 cents a gantang till the 13th. thereafter at 50 cents until farther notice. Four koyans were purchased at once, and a quantity has been brought in since by Dayaks, over 9 koyans being received in the month. The Native Court house has been temporarily converted into the rice , store, and Government is selling at 60 cents a gantang. This step has been much appreciated by those dependent on the bazaar for their supplies, on which the shop-keepers were making a profit of anything up to 100%. At the end of a month the Government buying price was reduced to 40 cents and sales effected at 50 cents. 600 pasus were forwarded to the Food Control in Kuching. The pity is that native rice cannot be kept for any length of time. This rice comes into the bazaar by the trading boats, who receive same in small quantities from the Dayaks by barter for salt, tobacco and oil, etc., the Chinaman making a profit both ways. It is a great pity the Dayaks should sell their rice early in the year, but the custom is very difficult to stop —as they for the most part have no other mode of exchange. I am trying to get the Penghulus to persuade their people not to pound their padi, but use this only for purchasing their minor needs. However, bv sending the rice beyond our requirements to Kuching, I hope to be able to keep the majority of the padi purchased by Government in reserve here. A salute of 7 guns was fired from the Fort on the 18th. to usher in the Mohammedan Fasting month. I left for Lubok Antu on the 22nd accompanied by Abaug Haji Buasan, Abang Dul and Abang Abutalip (Saratok) with Penghulus Labang and Mumin (Skrang), Unji (Layer), Majeng and Santok (Undup), Renang (Batang Ayer), Linang (Strap), Nyaiom (Sebuyow), Luta (Paku), Sujang (Rimbas), Nyalu (Awek), Nuga (Krian) and Engkamat (Seblak) and headmen of the Skrang. Batu Kudi was reached the same evening, and P. Suel and other Lemanak headmen joined us there. A heavy fresh stopped us for the night at Jangan’s house on the 23rd. and Lubok Antu was not reached till next mid-day. We left for the Ulu Ai on the 25th. our party being increased by the addition of Penghulus Ramba (Mepi), Embuas (Pan). Ringgit (Lubok Antu) and Awan (Kumpang). Owing to another fresh in the river we only reached P. Embuas’ house that evening.

Setai, a Bintulu Melano, was sentenced to six months for theft of jelutong. No other cases call for special mention.
   Tubau.— I was away from 11th.— Kith, accompanied by the Native Officer, Datu Haji Abdullah, visiting Pandan and the Sebaoh where a dispute about Dayak farming land in that river required settlement. I found no reason to alter the original boundary; other cases were also heard.
   From 26th.—30th. I visited Pandan, Labang and Tuban, accompanied by the Native Officer, Abang Naga At the last place I noticed very large quantities of bilian attap and understood they were for shipment to Kuching.
   General.—Proclamation Day, May 24th. was observed as a public holiday and the offices were closed.		
   Five hundred dollars in small silver and ten cent notes was received from the Treasury and distributed in the bazaars. A certain amount of change was taken up-river and distributed amongst the shop-holders.
   P. W. D. The prisoners were engaged during the month in whitewashing Government buildings. Arrangements were made with Dayaks to work bilian to be used as masts at the proposed wireless station.
   P. S. Adeh entered twice and called off Kidurong point once on her way North during the month. European passengers were Miss Swayne, who is paying a visit to this station, Messrs. A. E. Lawrence, Allman and Whittaker. Mr. Lawrence remained here till the return trip of the steamer and during his stay selected a site for a wireless station. S. S. Sarawak called twice for cargo and m. t. Miri also entered on two occasions, on the last visit, Mr. Warren of-the Anglo-Saxon Oil Company spent a few days in the district making enquiries about a timber supply.
   The total rainfall for the month was 3’54 inches.

   The drop in the price of local produce reacted directly on the Court of Requests which has been busy during the whole month. Other matters before the Court related to disputes about jelutong road. An inheritance case of some importance was held over owing to the sudden illness of the defendant immediately before the hearing.
   P. W. D. The prisoners were mainly engaged upon the roads and ditches in the kampong. Four bilian posts, two of 60 feet and two of 50 feet were delivered by Dayaks; it is proposed to utilise those for the wireless station.
   General. Hari Raya fell on the 18th. and was observed as a public holiday; the flagstaff was dressed and the usual salute fired. Owing to a serious attack of malaria I accompanied Miss Swayne to Kuching to obtain medical advice and was away  from the station from the 3rd.—23rd.
   Tenders for the farms here and at Tatau were opened at the end of the month and produced a very small increase in rental from the old farmers.
   
   No new agent for the opium farm having been appointed, Sin Watt Ann, the old farmer handed over his stock for safe keeping in the Fort, as he refused any further responsibility for it.
   The rainfall for the month amounted to 8'71 inches.
   Trade returns.
Next day we arrived at P. Rambus house, and on the 27th we visited the houses in the Mepi Krangan Telaus was reached the next day, and on the 29th, we visited all the bouses in the Meniang. I heard one or two cases there next morning, Umpieng of Meniang being fined ½ a pikul for bringing a false accusation against the Penghulus and Government, and detained under an armed guard till the fine was paid in full P. Baroh’s house at Nanga Delok was reached the same evening, in spite of another very heavy fresh, my boat nearly coming to grief at Pangin. On the 30th. all the houses in the Delok were visited. The Ulu Ai Dayaks followed all the correct Dayak customs on their reception of the down-river chiefs, who were everywhere greeted with every sign of friendliness and good-will. 1 was still at P. Baroh’s house on the 31st., arrangements having been made for all the up-river Penghulus and heads of houses to meet us at Krangan Telaus on the 3rd in order to settle the terms of the peace-making to take place between the Skrangs, Layers and Lemanaks before His Highness the Rajah at Simanggang in August. Several long-standing disputes came up before the chiefs, and were settled by them in conjunction with the Ulu Ai Penghulus.
   Court. At Simanggang, Chula just released from gaol was again found guilty of theft and sentenced to one year imprisonment.
   Ah Lon of Sabu was sentenced to six months imprisonment for assault with a weapon on his Dayak mistress. Jat Phoo, his son, who helped in the assault on his mother, received six strokes of the rotan.
   Galan of Banting was fined 1 pikul for bringing a false accusation of bribery against P. Augkon. Gendot and Sudan of Spaoh were severely fined for assault on Oi Chong in his shop there, and all concerned in the affray required to put in heavy pledges for their future behaviour. Biju of Strap was fined 20 katis for libvl on P. Linang. There has been a positive epidemic of such cases in the past two months. In all instances the accusations of bribery and corruption were thorough investigated and in no case was there any evidence whatsoever to justify such serious slanders on Government servants, which were invariably found to have been started by one who had been unsuccessful in some previous litigation quite justly settled by the Penghulu. Munah (f) of Sebuyow was fined 1 pikul for procuring abortion, and Enjon bini Maol, against whom certain accusations were brought in the above case, was ordered to find security of 2 pikuls pending further enquiries.
   Mr. W. F. Dick in my absence reports having received a remittance of $9,000 in small denomination notes, and silver from the Kuching Treasury. Certain share holders in the Hong Line kongsi took exception to the sale of the s.l. Hong Line to Chop Eng Seng of Sibu and as this matter appeared irregular from the inception, the document concerning same was not registered, and the matter- was adjourned pending further investigation.
