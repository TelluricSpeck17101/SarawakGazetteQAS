   THE old saying of “more haste less speed” has proved itself applicable to the Kuching Railway System. What was perhaps an unequalled record in any other Railway System in the world, namely never to have had a serious accident, has now been broken. Perhaps the fact that there are only three locomotives on the line made some of the more enlightened members of the public try to make up for this shortage of trains by an increase in speed. At any rate some genius, no doubt with the intention of assisting the Government in getting the best out of the locomotives, on two occasions on the 7th. and 8th. instant greased the rails on part of the grade between the 7th. and 5th. mile stations. This caused the Railway authorities considerable, trouble, and might easily have resulted in a serious accident involving considerable loss of life. The public are asked to report or give in charge any suspicious characters seen walking along, the line carrying grease pots.
  On the morning of the 8th. an unfortunate accident occurred just outside Kuching station, the 11.30 up passenger train collided with the ballast train coming down. The coolie mandor of the latter was slightly injured and the ends of the two locomotives slightly damaged.

CHINESE TRADING DEVELOPMENT.
   One of the most striking features of the past decade in the Straits has been (says the Free Press) the phenomenal development of commercial concerns among the Chinese. It is no new tiling io discover that the Chinese are excellent business men, that their age-old methods of book-keeping and systems of credits and banking are not only sound, but were long far in advance of European methods. When our ancestors were running about in blue undress clothes in the woods, the Chinese were practising many of the rules of business -which belong to a highly civilised state of Society. But the remarkable change to which we refer is the development of the limited liability company business among the Straits Chinese. They have long been proprietors of private trading concerns which have partners of limited liability, ship companies and merchants with an elaborate system of divisions of the profits, but there has always been a strong personal element in their business. The Towkay, or the chief proprietor of the chop, himself usually attended to the business and as a rule looked into the details pretty closely with his manager or chief assistant. This acted admirably in the case of industries and business dealing with concrete values, for “the master's eye is worth forty per cent" in business. The Chinese now have companies for banking, for insurance, for investments, for trusteeships, for land, for a combine of industries, or a monopoly far exceeding in number the concerns often years ago, and this is a different kind of "business” depending largely on the area over which the Company is working. It is too soon vet to say how these concerns will turn out. A life assurance company, for in-
stance, must have survived a score of years before it quite knows where it stands. A fire insurance company has to spread its risks over a wide field, and guard nganisl a stunning loss by reinsurances. A bank is not merely a place where depositors dock to leave their money and send cheques to get some of it out. There does not, however, seem any reason why entirely Chinese managed affairs, restricted to Chinese shareholders, as is the case with the lately established Lee Wah Bank, should not serve a useful purpose among the already prosperous Chinese community. The rub, of course, comes in when these purely Chinese concerns come info contact with what are practically international enterprises. Take for instance a Japanese Bank in Singapore. It could not doubt do good business among the nationals of Japan who live here. But it is not just for that purpose that the big Japanese banks come. The branches are a part of the great commercial and financial world, and that we suppose will be the next development of the Chinese companies, who are well enough aware of the requisites for successful and world-wide business. There is no doubt plenty of capital available, though possibly not too much for the big schemes that are afloat.
It is believed to be a characteristic of the Chinese to expect to see a return on their money very soon after putting it in. That is hardly possible in the more intricate commercial ventures which they are not attempting. Meanwhile, it is interesting to read that there is a proposal, to be considered at Penang on the 15th, for the formation of a Chinese Planter's Association of Malaya, a further move for combination for business purposes which might have a beneficial result on the industry.— (The Strait Echo.)
A slight idea of how business is increasing in North Borneo may be gained from the fact that the number of telegrams handled by the wireless stations

Retirement of the Honble.
J. Baring-Gould.
—?—
   On completing 21 years service in Sarawak the Honble J. Baring-Gould, Resident of the 3rd Division left Sibu by H. H. S. Y. Zahora on April 28th. for Kuching en route for Europe.
   The yacht was to leave Sibu at 10 a. m. and unfortunately heavy rain sei in an hour before, which however cleared a few minutes before 10 a.m. but in spite of the weather the photographer managed to obtain a photograph of Mr. Baring-Gould surrounded by his officers both European and Native.
   Owing however to date of his leaving Sibu having been changed but a few days previous, the short notice prevented the gathering from being as representative of the Division as it would otherwise have been.
   The Chinese Cadet Corps, headed by their bugle band, escorted Mr. Baring-Gould, who walked under the shade of a beautifully worked red silk umbrella of Chinese design, across the Island and through the bazaar to the wharf where an enormous gathering of Chinese and Natives were assembled to wish him good-bye.
   The Foochow Colony presented him with an illuminated framed address and the Malays were to have read a complimentary farewell in verse but this was rendered utterly impossible by the continuous roar of Chinese crackers and the dense cloud of smoke that rolled across the wharf and yacht, so copies were presented instead.
   After shaking hands with many of his Chinese and Native friends on the wharf he went on board the yacht where the Europeans were assembled to wish him goodbye. The healths of himself Mrs. Baring-Gould and family were heartily drunk, final farewells were said and the yacht left amid the explosion of cases of crackers and the hearty farewell cheers of the huge crowd assembled on the wharf.
   Mrs. Baring-Gould and her children went home in January and that they will all long live to enjoy
health and happiness in the Old Country is the sincere wish of their many friends in Sarawak.
   We hear that Mr. Baring-Gould was fortunate in procuring a berth on an Austrian Lloyd steamer bound for Venice directly he arrived in Singapore and that he will proceed overland from Venice to England.
The Gutta-percha Industry in the
Straits Settlements.
—?—
By Consul-General Edwin N. Gunsaulus.
   Gutta-percha is a jungle product, obtained from trees growing wild in tropical forests. "Borneo, particularly Sarawak, supplies the largest quantities, although Sumatra and the Federated Malay States furnish a certain amount. Some efforts have been made to cultivate the gutta-percha tree on estates, but they do not appear to have been successful, which is due to the fact that the tree can only thrive in certain localities possessing the requisite humidity or rainfall and good drainage such as afforded by foot-hills, and these conditions occur very seldom outside of certain jungle areas. So far as can be learned there is only one district in Sarawak where gutta-percha trees have been cultivated with any success. This plantation has now been in existence about 30 years, arid is only just beginning to yield supplies in marketable quantities. In this connection it may be stated that about 20 years are required before the trees are in a fair way to produce. If trees are tapped earlier the production is small, and a great risk is run of the trees withering and dying before fully matured. This fact in itself would discourage the investment of any large capital in the industry, to say nothing of the extreme difficulty in successfully cultivating the trees outside of their native jungles.

Methods of Collection - Increase in Production.
   The milk of the gutta-percha is obtained by tapping, but in many cases the trees are cut down in order to obtain larger quantities. While this process does not actually destroy the life of the tree, inasmuch as new shoots will in time spring from the stump, it effectually cuts off the source of supply for many years. For this reason the felling of gutta-percha trees has, it is understood, been prohibited in Sarawak.
   The latex is collected by natives, brought down to various villages, and bartered to the Chinese for rice, tapioca, salt, etc. At the present time, owing to the high cost of rice, the natives must collect considerably more than in former years in order to secure needed supplies of this staple article of diet.
   The production of gutta-percha in the various districts in this section is estimated to have been between 450 and 500 long tons in 1918, while in 1919 it was between 600 and 700 tons. The production is regulated according to existing values, and, should prices advance, it is to be anticipated that for 1920 it will amount to 800 or 900 tons. It is known that the production of gutta-percha is stimulated by further special inducements being made to the natives, who are the actual collectors. Without such inducements it is not probable that any appreciable increase in the present output of the commodity will be effected.
   Within the last five years increases of from 80 to 100 per cent, have taken place in prices.
   The local, as well as neighbouring. Press has recently published articles to the effect that projects were on foot looking to the construction of Pacific cables, in one instance from the United States to the Philippine Islands, and in another from the United States to Japan. Neither report has as yet been confirmed, but it is not unlikely that even rumours of


142	THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, JUNE 16, 1920.
this nature will have a tendency to stiffen the market, not only in view of the considerable quantities of gutta-percha that such an undertaking would require, but as a result of the keen competition that would set in.
   Another point to be carefully borne in mind with regard to the production and cost of gutta-percha is the constantly increasing area of land under rubber, coconut, and tapioca cultivation. These new estates are well regulated, and offer every inducement to the coolie type in the way of compensation and better standards of living. This class of work will therefore undoubtedly attract the native and coolie labour away from the jungle, and the clearing of so many tracts of
land may mean the diminution of jungle areas and a consequent decrease in jungle products.

MONTHLY REPORTS
UPPER SARAWAK.
BAU AND PAKU.
—?—
May.
   Court work was light during the month. There were a few cases of theft.
   A Javanese from Puak was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for the theft of a uniform case containing clothing from a bungalow. The theft took place some time ago, but up to this month no trace was found of the missing articles, which were eventually nearly all recovered.
   A Chinese was imprisoned for stealing $65 in notes from the coat of a passenger on the Chinese launch running between Kuching and Buso. All the passengers were searched on arrival by the police, and the missing notes were found in the turned up trouser leg of the accused. The man admitted the theft, but stated that at the time he was overcome by the suggestions of an evil spirit. One or two other cases of petty theft were dealt with.
   A Chinese coolie from Tundong was imprisoned for a violent assault on another coolie.
   The Buso police reported the loss of over 100 tapping cups. No trace has been found of the thief.
   An escaped prisoner from Kuching was arrested in the Bau bazaar, and returned to Kuching jail.
   At the request of the Superintendent of Police a Chinese named Hong Choon Nyan was sent back to Kuching immediately on his arrival at Bau. This man professed to be a medical expert, his method of diagnosing being to examine the middle finger of the patient.
   The death of a Chinese pepper gardener was reported on the 30th. The deceased was gathering pepper, and fell from the ladder, dying instantly.
   Ou enquiry it transpired that the man had been in a very weak state for some time.
   Mr. B. Stooke was at Bau on the 13th. and 14th. on business connected with the Forestry Department.
   I started for the left-hand branch on the 23rd., arriving at Geit on the first evening. During the night a heavy fresh came down, but subsided in the morning, although the river was still rather high, and a good deal of difficulty was experienced in getting up the first “giam”. The night of the 24th, was spent at Brang, and on the following morning I arrived at Pengkallan Ampat. After examining the Government bungalow at this place, I decided to pitch a tent and live there, rather than occupy the bungalow, which is perched on the top of an exceedingly precipitous hill where no water can be obtained. I have arranged to have the building pulled down and re-erected on a convenient site near the water.
   While at Peugkallan Ampat I collected practically
all the Dayak Revenue and also a quantity of Chinese
assessment, Pepper tax, etc.
   The Chinese are exceedingly anxious to farm padi
this year, but have been unable to get land from the Dayaks for this purpose. On talking the matter over I found that the Dayaks suspected that the land would be planted up with pepper after the harvest, and were therefore unwilling to allow the Chinese the use of it. I assured the Dayaks that this would not be allowed, and I trust that they will now let the Chinese have sufficient land to plant up this year.
   It appears that rice and padi is the usual currency in use between Dayaks and Chinese when trading, and I allowed the latter to continue to receive this on the conditions that it was handed over to the Government either in Bau or Kuching, and was on no account to be otherwise disposed of.
   I left Pengkallan Ampat on the morning of the 28th., stopping once or twice on the way down to take in tax, and arrived nt Siniawan at 11 p. m. I walked up to Bau the same night.
   During the month eight buffaloes have been slaughtered, and their is a good demand for the meat, which is sold off at 30 cents per katty. I am trying to get one of the local Chinese to take up this business, purchasing the beasts in Kuching, and selling here at the same rate.
   The prison gang has been employed on roads. The
road from Peringgok to Bau bazaar has been raised where necessary. Work is hindered by the gang being continually required for other odd jobs
   The rainfall for the month taken at Bau was 15’40 inches.

SADONG.
May.
   Mr. C. G. Dun left for Kuching by Pce. Sri Marion
on the 3rd.
   The padi godown was finished on the 9th. and eight coyans of padi stored away.
   On the 10th. accompanied by Mr. E. H. Haldane, I left for Tebakang to collect the Dayak tax.
 We spent the night at Gedong, where the Melikin Dayaks paid in about two and half coyans of padi, and this was sent off to Simunjan by tongkang that night. Empungan was reached the following evening, and the padi there being all ready was measured, and despatched the next morning. We arrived at Tebakang on the 12th. At this place I was kept very busy, and boat loads of padi were sent off daily to Empungan.
   By the 23rd. all had been moved to that place; and at the time of writing practically all has been brought safely to Simunjan and stored. Thirty three coyans have been handled.
   Transportation and labour were a little difficult, and the work was nearly all done by prisoners, who have been on the river twenty days, and who, although having no one to watch them between places, have worked exceedingly well and quickly.
   From Tebakang I visited Pichiu and Krosen spending a night in each place, and from the latter proceeded to Retu and Temah, and then up the river Suhu to Tebidoo.
   There are four Chinese shops at this place, and about thirty Chinese, but I am not sure that they do any good there. Heretofore their principal trade has been in rice and padi, which was sold across the border, or shipped to Sarawak. I don’t quite know what else they trade in, there was nothing in their shops. I learned that this little colony is a


THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, JUNE 16, 1920.	143
very old one, and that they originally came over from the Dutch side, and settled at Tebidoo first, and later some of them went to Tebakang and settled there.
   They have acquired land from the Dayak at one time or another, and have planted pepper and rubber, and are gradually encroaching. I do not know whether these Chinese, living so close to the border and planting pepper, etc., are more valuable to the State than the Dayaks who plant padi only, but I am in favour of the latter, and have refused to issue any more permits to Chinese to plant anything more on Dayak land.
   They bribe the Orang Kaya’s and the land is handed over to them: but this should not be allowed as the Dayaks will be short of fanning land another day.
   All the Dayaks have plenty of padi this year and seem very contented.
   I returned to Simunjan on the 27th.
   While at Tebakang I visited all the shops to try and find some silver dollars and copper money. I took away $1,500 in silver, giving notes in exchange, and about $100 in copper. I feel sure there is a great deal more copper there, but although I searched every where, could not find it. One, Sam Pok, had over $700 in silver, and had also defaced some by making them into a belt for a Dayak lady. He was fined $200 and the confiscated dollars will be sent to the Treasury.
   There was a shooting accident at the Colliery at about 2 a. m. on the 10th. when Ah Lak, the second clerk at the mines, shot a Chinese coolie through the
head, killing him instantly.
   Ah Lak was watching for pigs in a large kribang patch, the light was bad. He saw what he naturally took to be a pig, moving between the furrows, and fired. The pig however turned out to be one of the coolies who had actually been crawling along stealing kribang, a sumpit half full of fresh dug kribang found beside him.
   An enquiry has been held, and Ah Lak exonerated from blame.
   This ought to have been a lesson to other thieves,
but apparently not, as Mr. Evans tells me that two nights later, two coolies were chased away from the same place.
   The Forest Checking Station is well under way end the building should be finished iu about two weeks time.
   The Dayak tax shows an increase this year of $407, and amounted to $4,375.
   Nine steamers and seven schooners have entered
and cleared the port during the month.

The gross out-put for the month was 2,140-12 tons, 465 tons of which was consumed by our boilers, and 1,675-12 tons was delivered to the wharf for export.
The shipments for the month were as follows:—

               Total Shipments       1,617-10 ,,
   
   The mines in both the upper and lower seams produced well during the month.
   Chin Hin, a Lewchew Chinese mine coolie, while out stealing kribang in the Government field at 2 a. m. on the morning of the 10th. was mistaken for a wild pig by H. Ah Lak, our second clerk, in the moonlight, and was fatally shot.
   Ah Tham, a Chinese mandor, left for Kuching and Upper Sarawak early in the month to try and recruit Chinese labour for the mines, and returned a fortnight later without a single man.
   Mr. Holl visited the Collieries on the 11th. and left again by the a. s. Alice Lorraine on the 13th.
   The railway hue was extended 100 yards further East, and everything went well in the mechanical department.
   The usual Pile-driving and repairing work was carried out at the wharf, and coaling vessels were loaded by gangs of labourers from the mines.
   The rainfall for the month was 6'60 inches.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, JUNE 16, 1920.
   $500 subsidiary small silver was received from Kuching Treasury. This was badly required as there was great difficulty procuring small change of any kind.
   Towards the end of the month the arrack farmer stated be was unable to make any-more spirit as he could obtain no cargo rice or padi. The farm was put up for auction again, there were no bidders.
   The various Government buildings were white- washed by the prisoners and fortmen.
   The people belonging to different kampongs cleared the cattle ground, which was much over grown.
This should ensure sufficient pasturage for the herd.
The p.s. Adeh called off twice, both to and on her return from the North. Now, however, I understand this will cease unless this station can guarantee 30 passengers.
   Raw sago was fetching $1.60 a pasu, there was also a big drop in jelutong.
   With regard to the junk about which I reported last month, it was impossible to break her up. Her masts, riggings, anchor etc. were salved and put up for auction. Marks have been placed pointing out where she lies.
   Most of the Dayak door tax has been paid in. None of it was paid in padi as the Dayaks stated they had only enough for their own consumption. No doubt last year’s experience has taught them to be careful. It is possible, however, that some may be forthcoming when they see what kind of crop the next one may be.
   The chief exports were:—
        1920.	1919.
    Raw sago   ... 693 koyans                530 koyaus
    Jelutong     ... 548 piculs                 1,120 piculs	
   36 sailing vessels entered and 37 cleared dining the month.

PROVISIONS.
    WE beg to announce that we have recently been appointed Sole Agents in Sarawak, Brunei and British North Borneo for Messrs. Joseph Travers & Sons, Limited, proprietors of the well-known “SHIP” and “SIGNAL” brands of TINNED PROVISIONS and are now ready to commence business on wholesale lines.
    It is still impossible to obtain adequate supplies from England and the Colonies but the situation becomes easier week by week and we hope shortly to be able to meet all demands. 
    We shall be pleased to send price lists on application.
