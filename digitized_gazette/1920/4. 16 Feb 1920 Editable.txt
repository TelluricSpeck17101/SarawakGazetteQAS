Roman Catholic Mission.
—?—
   The departure of the Rev. Father A. Stotter, who has gone to take up a new appointment in the Sandakan district of British North Borneo, removes from Sarawak one who has a record of over twenty years service as a missionary priest among the Milano people of the upper Oya.
   Father Stotter came out to Borneo in 1897, was first stationed at Kanowit and then for a short time in the lower Rejang. Thence he went to the border of the Milano district and established a mission school at the Igan end of the Cut, that small waterway half natural and half artificial which joins the Igan and Oya rivers. At first the mission station there was quite a small affair, but it grew rapidly until in place of the leaf-thatched sheds which housed the inmates in 1901 substantial wooden buildings were erected, including church, boys’ school and convent and the staff was largely augmented.
   The Cut mission continued to increase and established a colony in the Oya river but, in 1918, it was
decided to move and the school and convent were re-opened at Dalat in the Oya river, where they still flourish. Except for one or two short periods when be went to Europe on leave Father Stotter acted as rector of this mission from the time of its establishment until his present departure for British North Borneo.

   Now the war is over
   Price of rice is high
   Shades of insurrection
   Steal across the sky
   
   Soon the brass bats gather
   Waking from their sleep
   Chinks, Malays and Dayaks
   Cry “give it to us cheap"
   
   Council grants the native
   Free food, smokes and clothes
   Whilst the Orang Puteh
   Is paying through the nose
   
   There's no hope of profit
   There's no chance of gain
   Unless the blooming Javanese
   Their appetites restrain.
   
   Through the long night watches
   The planter kneels in prayer
   Lest those who plan some evil
   May raise the price of beer.
   
   When the morning wakens
   His weary way he wends
   Wondering will it interfere
   With his dividends.
   
   Glory to the raindrops
   Glory to the sun
   And to all things that don't eat rice
   And make the latex run.

SADONG.
—?—
November, 1919.
   Mr. R. G. Hunt of the British Malaysian Rublier Co., returned from Gedong on the 1st and left for Goebilt the same night by s. l. Margaret.
   A mechanic arrived from Kuching by s.s. Alice Lorraine on the 7th. He inspected the wireless plant, and returned to Kuching by the same vessel the following day. Mr. E. H. Haldane of the Sarawak Rubber Estates Co., also took passage to Kuching.
   There were very high tides on 9th, 10th and 11th. The water reached the bottom step of the Residency: the wharf was inundated : and the water was so near the rice godown that it was necessary to move all the rice, sack the padi, and build a platform in the godown ; the night, after this was done water actually entered the godown. I am told that this has never happened More.
   On the 16th motor tongkang Moratebas arrived with Mr. Hunt from Goebilt.
   The s.s. Sarawak arrived later in the day bringing Mr. J. C. Swayne and Mr. Haldane. Messrs. Swayne and Hunt left the following day for Kuching by tongkang Moratebas.
   On the 20th accompanied by Mr. Haldane, I left for Tabekang. We reached Gedong the same evening, and Court was held there that night. Ah Guan brought a long list of cases of breach of agreement to work timber for the Sadong Colliery. Many of these documents dated back to 1917, and in many eases not a stick of timber had been delivered. Those people who could be found, were brought before the Court, and some received the maximum penalty. The remainder I learned upon my return had all gone up-river, and were busy working timber to fulfil their contracts.
   We reached Tabekang on the evening of the 22nd.
   During the next two days Court was held, and various matters attended to. Here again were cases of breach of agreement. It appears that these Malays, being rather far from the reach of the law, take advances and make contracts with apparently no intention whatever, of fulfilling them.
   Dayaks were not over numerous, being busy on their farms, and there was only one land case, and that concerning the destruction of fish ponds built by Rayang Dayaks on Bukar Dayaks' farming lands. A letter however signed by the Superintendent of Surveys, and produced by the defendants, made the case very easy.
   On the 25th we went to Pichin. I was much struck by the populous state of this village, and the healthy appearance of the children. I saw no skin disease there at all and the people seemed much more settled and contented than the nomadic Sea Dayaks.
of the ulus Oya and Mukah. Their only complaint was that they had not enough land to farm, and they asked for a share of land claimed by the Juian Dayaks, which they said bad not been cultivated for about twenty years. As these people are related, a division of this sort ought not to be hard to arrange.
    On the 27th we visited the Krosen Dayaks. Their only complaint was against a Chinaman Ah Soon living at their pengkallan, who had been granted land by their late Penglima to plant certain coconuts and gutta rian trees, but who was now encroaching on their farming land, and had planted pepper. They also complained of him on other accounts, and obviously do not like him. It was found to be true that he had planted pepper without permission, or permit and he was fined and warned that if there were any further complaints against him, he would be turned out.
    We returned to Tabekang on the 28th. All weights and measures were examined, hut as they had been examined as lately as last May nothing wrong was found with them.
    We left Taliekang on the 29th and reached Gedong
the same evening.
    The weights and measures in this bazaar, which had not been examined for some years, were tested. The dachings, the gantang. chupak and leng measures, were all right: but the yard measures, with only one exception, were all too short. One belonging to a Christian Chinaman named Siang Inn was as much as an inch and a quarter short. All the owners were accordingly fined and the sticks destroyed.
    We left Gedong the following morning and arrived at Siniunjan in the afternoon.
    All the padi, both hill and lowland, was looking splendid and everyone is anticipating a good harvest.
    There was a very severe wind storm here on the evening of the 28th and a good deal of damage was done. Eight houses were blown down including Mr. Haldane's, which was a pretty shaky affair and was entirely destroyed. I have allowed him to occupy the European quarters in the wireless station for the time being subject to the approval of the Superintendent of Telegraphs.
    Five angsena trees and one coconut tree all close to the Court house were blown over; this is a great pity, and makes the building look very bare.
    On my return from Tabekang, Bujang, wireless-mechanic, reported that the wireless engine had failed owing to a leaking cylinder. This was taken down and sent to Kuching by s.s. Alice Lorraine for repairs.
    There were six hundred and eighty-four bags of rice, ten bags of maize meal and seven bags of locally grown ubi bandong distributed during the month.
    Ten thousand dollars worth of notes were remitted to the Sarawak Treasury by s. s. Alice Lorraine on the 14th, but apparently the money was miscounted, as only nine thousand nine hundred and sixty dollars was received.
    Sixteen thousand dollars odd was received towards
the end of the month from sales of rice, etc.
   The prisoners have been employed during the whole month farming.
    The rainfall was 17’76 inches.
    Ten steamers and five schooners entered and cleared the port during the month.
    There were exported 1,276 tons 1 cwt. of coal valued at $7,656.80.

LOWER REJANG.
—?—
January.
   I arrived at Rejang on the 3rd. The only case of importance brought before the Court was that of Lani
Kee a vagrant and thief who on second conviction was sentenced to a term of imprisonment followed by banishment. Most of the people were busy on their farms or working jelutong. Owing to the enhanced price of jelutong, the Island Trading Company find great difficulty in procuring labour to work the bark. On 9th I left for Daro and thence on 11th for Matu. There were the usual number of cases brought before the Court. The only one of importance was that of brawling in the bazaar, in which fines were imposed on various persons. It would be of great benefit to have a telephone line erected from the Court house to the Police Station. The line could run along the road which is about two miles in length and I was given to understand by the Chinese that they were prepared to contribute something towards the erection. I left for Daro on the 16th and returned to Sibu early on the 18th. At all these places the absolute need for husbanding their incoming padi harvest, was impressed upon the natives: also the desirability of registering the amount that each household garners in.

BINTULU.
—?—
December, 1919.
   Although the weather has been rough at times there have been calm intervals so that the supply of fresh fish never failed for more than a few days at a time. Down here near the sea there has also been surprisingly little rain -for a landas month, but plenty must have fallen inland for the river was constantly in flood.
   Rice became very scarce so that the people of the country were practically living on sago and fish and the supply in the bazaar became so low that express messengers had to be sent to Miri with a request to the Honble. the Resident 4th Division to wireless Kuching for more, which H. H. S. Y. Zahora brought
on Christmas day.
   It is the fault of the Chinese themselves that they ran out of rice in this way. For months they have been warned to keep sufficient for their own consumption but have preferred to trade it away, largely on credit to those natives who will promise to deliver jelutong in return, and then throw the onus of feeding them upon the Government. However a repetition of this has been made impossible by issuing ration cards to all the Chinese and retailing rice to them in accordance with their fixed allowances.
   For some time there have been three schooners in the river, two of which have made several demonstrations of sailing for Kuching but have each
time come back to their anchorage. At least twice there seemed no adequate reason for returning, but it seems that each demonstration was preceded by a demand from the owner of fresh stores of rice for the
journey, which were not returned when the attempt failed. Thus the crews have been able to live, until the supply gave out entirely, on a full diet of rice unmixed with any substitute foodstuffs. Sailors and juragans are not easy to obtain just now, or perhaps the owners would not have stood this artless little stratagem for so long.
   H. H. S. Y. Zahora dropped mails at Kidurong on 6th but as her visit was quite unexpected our mails for Kuching had not been sent over to wait for
her and were consequently still hung up until the Zahora again arrived on the 25th.
    Four Dayaks from the Batang Lupar working jelutong in this district were murdered on the 22nd by a party led by a tuai rumah named Bu, formerly of the Batang Rejang, and a few others. A brother of Bu, named Mulieng, had been found dead in the jungle, where he was making a boat, with his head smashed and by the time this news reached Bu's house it had apparently developed into a rumour that Mulieng had been killed by another person, whereas the truth seems to be that he met his death by an accident caused through his own carelessness. Bu and his party went up to investigate, but, hearing there were four Dayaks from another district working not far away, abandoned their intention, decided to fix the guilt of Mulieng’s death upon these unfortunate people, killed all four and took their heads. I think that if Penghulu Beti had asserted his
authority and taken steps to prevent anything like this happening these four men would never even have been in any danger of losing their lives. All who were in any way concerned in the deaths have been arrested and the four heads are in the hands of Government. Reports of the affair were sent to His Highness the Rajah and the Honble. the Resident 3rd Division and the ring-leaders were sent to Sibu via Kuching. Copies of the evidence taken will follow by the next mail.
    Telephone service between here and Tatau has been unsatisfactory all through the month chiefly owing to breakages in the old wire between Setiam and Semanok.

   Early in the month news was received that the light at Baram point had ceased to revolve: shipping was at once notified, and I proceeded there on the 4th to overhaul the mechanism. After refilling the mercury bath in which the lenses float and cleaning and oiling the clockwork, the light commenced revolving again on the 7th instant.
   H. H. S. Y. Zahora arrived from Kuching on the 6th with a cargo of rice and mails; she left for Brooke ton the same day.
   Mr. F. H. Kortright returned from furlough on the 17th accompanied by Mrs. Kortright.
   Having received instructions from His Highness the Rajah to proceed to Limbang, I handed over the books and cash to Mr. Kortright on the 24th and the wireless installation on the 29th.
   Messrs. C. D. Adams and E. V. Audreini arrived from Baram via Lutong on the 23rd to spend Christmas and New Year here. Messrs. H. Reis and R. H. Blackmore accompanied by Mrs. Reis and Mrs. Blackmore and Messrs. E. G. Taylor and A. A. Robertson arrived during the month to join the staff of the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co., Ltd.
   In the Courts Chong Ah Cheng accused of the recent murderous assault on Mrs. Howard was discharged, as insufficient evidence was forthcoming to obtain a conviction Ah Chiaw was sentenced to six months H. L. for theft; Lim Wong a fireman of the s. s. Suran was fined for smuggling opium.
   Khang Sam, who recently escaped from custody, was recaptured and received the usual punishment ; Drahman bin Ahmat was sentenced to four months H. L. for theft of jelutong.
   Mr. Foien’s bungalow was broken into on the 11th and a Klondike gold watch and chain stolen ; there is as yet no trace of the culprit.
