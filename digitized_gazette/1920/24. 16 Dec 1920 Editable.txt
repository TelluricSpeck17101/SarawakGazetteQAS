   THE Supreme Court’s decision authorising the owners of liquors lawfully acquired and stored for their own use in places other than their homes to remove them has filled innumerable Americans with delight particularly clubmen, who assert that they are specially favoured by the new ruling as the men who use the clubs as their homes will probably be allowed to keep supplies of drinks in clubs. It is estimated that ten million gallons of liquor are now lying in the warehouses to be released while large quantities seized by the Government agents will be returned to the owners.—(Straits Echo.)
   THESE days of trade depression have their humourous incidents. Who has not heard of the local merchant of Hebrew descent who recently “went smash,” placed some goods in another warehouse in order that they should not be collared as assets, and then discovered when he went to recover the goods that his accommodating friends had also come to grief, and his precious property impounded after all, but to their credit and not to his ? Tat a bizness ’. —(Malaya Tribune.)
   MANY friends turned up on the steamer to say good-bye to Mr. and Mrs. Skrine who have gone to Kuala Lumpur where Mr. Skrine has obtained a post in a firm of solicitors. We wish him the best of luck in his new job.
   GIN and Bitters the Maias twins were also passengers to Singapore en route for their new home in the London zoo. The prospect of a long journey did not appear to upset their good humour or appetites.

    THE body of a Dayak named Jiti, a dresser in the Government Dispensary, was found by the roadside near the 4th. mile on the morning of the 6th. It is supposed that deceased shot himself, as his own gun was lying beside him with a piece of shoelace tied round the trigger. There are however some suspicious points in connection with the affair which are being investigated. Jiti suspected his wife of misconduct with Tan Cheng Pun against whom he had taken action in the Courts but the case had not been tried up to the time of his death.
                           UNLUCKY No. 4.
    PITY the poor unemployed share brokers, says the Straits Echo. They have got to think about all sorts of things to pass the ' time away during the slump. One of the ' latest is a pack of five cards with “Who's who” , on the backs. These are shuffled, and each man draws one. The man who draws the card with No. 1 on the face finds written there, “Shall we have a drink?”; No. 2, “With pleasure”; No. 3, “Who pays?”: No. 4, “I do” ; 5, “Splendid. ’’
                        LETTERS OF CUTHBERT.
    MY DEAR PERCY.—Having returned from leave I find myself roped in on the guilded staff of Kuchingites. Do you remember how we, in the outstations, used to refer to such people as the lazy idle rich and envy them the splendour which we imagined surrounded them. Forget it Percy old bean it was all a myth. Here undoubtedly are the brains of the country, beside which we, I mean you cease to exist. Work to us is as the breath of life, we don’t even allow ourselves time to digest our food such is our hurry to return to the scene of action.
    Militarism is rife, marching and counter marching, drilling and rifle practice to the strains of fanfares of bugles. We seldom sleep, the buglers see to that. The league of nations ought to do something about it.
    At the club in the evening we play bridge to keep our brains active, but I really think some people are overdoing it. Frantic efforts are made to keep the New Club going but its an uphill fight. The old saying that no man is indispensable was never better illustrated than it is here at present. One man to six departments is quite common. This is apt to lead to confusion however, as was the case the other day when Lovett got quite stuffy with Jackson whom lie found holding his Lovett's Court instead of his, Jackson’s inquest. Everyone thought Lovett rather hasty, as one cannot possibly be expected to remember all one’s various jobs. We take our recreation very seriously and it has been suggested that those wishing to play a particular game at a particular time and place should be requested to sign each day a document stating full details and therein fail not, etc. It is feared however that this may lead to Bolshevism in its worst form in the event of people who have not signed insisting on joining in a game.
    Its ft great life my dear Perciyal if you don’t weaken.
Yours ever,
           .	CUTHBERT.

? 272	THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, DECEMBER 16, 1920.
          UPPER SARAWAK
                        BAU AND PAKU
                     November.
   The Resident of 1st. Division arrived at Ban on the 19th. instant, returning to Kuching via Buso on the afternoon of the 21st.
   No important eases have been before the Court 
during the month, in fact Court work has been exceptionally light. Numbers of thefts of foodstuffs have been reported, by gardeners, and there have been sonic cases of assault on gardeners by thieves, in one case the owner of the garden being rather badly cut with a parang while remonstrating with some men found digging up vegetables. No arrest has been made in this case.
   In consequence of the drop-in rubber the distress amongst the smaller planters is very great, but the relief measures adopted by Government are to a great extent alleviating this. On the larger plantations coolies are being dismissed as the owners find themselves unable to continue working expenses without any immediate returns. Numbers of these coolies have left the district and crossed the border to Sambas.
   The pepper planters are in particular badly hit as the bazaar Chinese on whom they have been accus-  tomed to depend for a living while waiting for their crop are now unable to continue giving advances.
   I am of opinion that some of the head Chinese in this district might make some small effort to assist Government in relieving the wants of their own people. Up to the present no such attempt seems to have been made.
   In consequence of reports received at the end of the month, a guard of Sarawak Rangers was asked for. These men left Kuching immediately, and were in the district the same evening.
   The prison gangs have been employed on roads, for the greater part of the month they have been raising the main bazaar road All other roads near the station have been cleaned.
 The police quarters at Siniawan have been demolished, and a tender accepted for a new building. Work on the building has been going on since the middle of the month.
   Necessary repairs to the Buso barracks are in I hand. The police quarters at Paku have been partly I demolished leaving accomodation for two men, quite sufficient for the present needs of that part of the district
   The contractor for the Siniawan to Batu Kitang Road was warned that his contract would be cancelled unless the road was immediately put into a proper state of repair.

November.
   The s. s. Alice Lorraine arrived on the 1st. The P. M. O. Dr. O. G. F. Luhn was passenger by her. He spent the following day, examining mine coolies and others, and left for Kuching that night, by same vessel.
   There has been a fair amount of Court work during the month. One Chan Luk, Hylam, was sentenced to two years for burglary. This man had only lately been released from Kuching jail, where he had completed a sentence of eighteen months,

for a similar offence. There have been several cases of thefts at the Collieries.
   On the 10th. six piles went out of the down-river end of the wharf, causing a partial collapse of the structure. The piles had been entirely perforated by kapang.
   The river bank from the D. O.’s bungalow grounds to the wharf is subsiding at an alarming rat.
   Mr. E. H. Haldane took passage by s. s. Alice Lorraine to Kuching on the 19th.
   On the 28th. the s. s. Alice Lorraine called here from Kuching en route for Sibu. She brought ten thousand dollars in notes for this Treasury. Passengers by her were Mr. E. H. Haldane for Sadong and Mr. D. A. Owen and Father Dun for Sibu. She sailed the same night.
   All reports from the padi farms up to date are excellent. On account of the low price of jelutong, people have stopped working to any extent, but have turned their attention to their farms, and the result has been, that a far greater area of land has been put under cultivation this year, than for many years past. Let us hope that the harvest will show an inert increased in proportion.
   The trade depression is being felt by many of the local
shop-keepers, and I am afraid several will come very near to bankruptcy.
	A subscription list has been started by the Chinese,
on their own initiative, for the relief of those starving in China. I do not know as yet what sum has been collected.
   Ten steamers and seven schooners entered and cleared the port during the month.

October;
   The gross out-put for the month was 1,960.14 tons, 465 tons of this was consumed by our boilers and 1,495 14 tons delivered to the wharf.
   The shipments for the month were as follows: —
    The Kuching Municipality	...	254.09 tons
    Messrs. The Borneo Co., Ltd.	...	625.13  ,,
    Bunkering s. l. Malacca ...	...	0.10 „
    Messrs. Paterson Simons&Co., S’pore   212.00 „
Total shipments 1,092.12 tons
   The balance of coal in stock on the wharf at the end of the month was 1,310.15 tons.
   Everything worked smoothly in the various departments, with the exception of the wharf, where the river is encroaching with damaging effect on the bank. 
   The quantity of coal shipped was below the average. The s. s. Gladys made one trip to Singapore at the end of the month.
   The new mines are making good progress. The upper seam mines and No. 8 mine in the lower seam produced a regular out-put. The east and west sections of No. 9 mine struck a good deal of barren ground during the month and the out-put on this account was irregular.
   The rainfall for the month was 12 80 inches and water supplies were sufficient.

   We shipped to Labuan 1,151 tons and supplied to
    p. s. Adeh and local launches 119 tons.
   We had in stock at the end of the month 1,099.25 tons. 
   Coal sales at Labuan amounted to 1,250 tons, 1,236 tons of this was taken by Messrs. The Straits Steamship Company’s steamers and the balance by local launches.
   Everything went smoothly in all departments. It will be noticed that the boiler consumption was very high, this was owing to three of the Lancashire boilers having to be kept under steam throughout the mouth, in consequence of the water in the mines having greatly increased owing to heavy rains.
   The work of clearing the large fall in the Buang Tawar oil level was carried on and nearly completed by the end of the month.
   The rainfall 21’02 inches.

  WE beg to announce that we have recently been appointed Sole Agents in Sarawak, Brunei and British North Borneo for Messrs. Joseph Travers & Sons, Limited, proprietors of the well-known “SHIP” and “SIGNAL” brands of TINNED PROVISIONS and are now ready to commence business on wholesale lines.
  ft is still impossible to obtain adequate supplies from England and the Colonies but the situation becomes easier week by week and we hope shortly to be able to meet all demands.
  We shall be pleased to send price lists on application.
