NOTES.
( April.)
   A Meeting of the New Club was held on the 6th instant when the Rules of the Club were passed. These are now being printed and will be issued to Members at an early date.
   THE p. S. Adeh returned on the 2nd from a trip to the North. Mr. and Mrs. Service returned in her and Major Benjamin, Manager of the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co. at Miri, took advantage of the opportunity to visit Kuching.
   A number of buffaloes were brought from Limbang and after these had been sold at auction and slaughtered, their meat was put upon the market at the new controlled price of 25 cents a catty. The rush of buyers showed how greatly this step was appreciated by the community generally.
   THE Right Reverend the Bishop of this Diocese, Mrs. Dunson and Major Benjamin sailed by the p. s. Adeh on the 7th. They were all three bound for Miri, the two former on a visit and the latter returning after his short stay in Kuching.
   EUROPEAN passengers to Singapore by the s. s. Kuching on the 9th were Mrs. U. Parnell, Dr. Hanton and Mr. J. M. Bryan. Mrs. Parnell is on her way to India, and, in spite of the fact that the boat sailed as early as 6.30 a.m., several people were on board to see her off and wish her “bon voyage.” Dr.

Hanton had gone to Goebilt the previous afternoon and boarded the Kuching from there. He goes to the U. S. A. on leave.
   FROM the result of an auction sale just held here it would seem that house property in Kuching is increasing in value. Two houses sold were estimated as worth $14,000 and $6,000 but actually realized $17,500 and $7,300 respectively.
   THE Venerable the Archdeacon of Kuching and Mis. Small are due back from leave in April of this year.
   Two new teachers for the S. P. G Mission schools, Miss Shoebridge and Miss Clark, are expected to come out from England shortly.

CORRESPONDENCE.
    [The Editor is not responsible for the opinions of correspondents.]
SIMANGGANG,
31st March, 1920.
The Editor,
Sarawak Gazette, 
     Kuching.

DEAR SIR,
    Referring to the Rev. Bern. Mulder’s, Mr. Archer’s and “Interested’s" letters in your issue of 16th March, suggesting a meeting between the Simanggang and Dalat crews, the Simanggang Regatta Fund Committee have decided to offer a Challenge Cup, value $100, for Competition at the Regatta held here annually about July. The Race will be over the Long Bedar course, and be open to any build of boat from any district, without any restrictions as to its length or the number of crew. The Cup will be competed for annually on the river from which the winning boat of the previous year came. So long as the Race is held in the Batang Lupar, the Siinang- gang Regatta Fund will provide an extra prize of $2 for each member of the winning boat’s crew, and a suitable prize for the second boat.
   I would point out that a suggestion that the Kuching Regatta might be held in the fine monsoon was sent in after the Sri Belalang's first success in Kuching two years ago—see correspondence in Gazette of 16th February 1918 but this met with no response.
   It is hoped that the present suggestion will meet with the Dalat Milano and other enthusiasts' approval, and provide the means for a proper test of the quality of boat-building and paddling, as well as encouraging friendly rivalry and intercourse between this and other rivers.
   I would add that only the first three boats in the Simanggang Champion Cup Race would be allowed
to compete here in this race, so there would be no overcrowding of the river. The field for the Long Bedar race here is generally over 15 boats, and even then there are no complaints. The Regatta is held of course during the slack tides. The visiting boats would also be eligible for entry in the other races for boats of their respective sizes.
   Entries for this Challenge Cup should be notified to the undersigned as soon as possible; and the owners of boats will be notified of the definite date of the Regatta in ample time.
   It is also hoped that we may at the same time lie able to welcome the owners themselves and all other Boat racing Enthusiasts.
 Yours faithfully,
            J. A. H. HARDIE.
                                  Hon. Secretary & Treasurer,
                                       Simanggang Regatta Fund.
Sadong Regatta.
—?—
   The annual Sadong Regatta was held on Monday March 29th. The weather was all that could be desired.
   There was only one new boat, which was owned by Mr. Lau Loong Quee and the prize list will show that it pays to build new boats occasionally, as old boats like most other old things (whisky excepted) must deteriorate. Congratulations are due to the owner. It is probable that this boat will compete in the next Sarawak Regatta and may upset all theories as to who are the best paddlers and boat builders in Sarawak !
   The wharf and river bank were thronged with people from all parts of the district and the youth and beauty of the community, gaily bedecked, could be seen peeping coyly from the numerous langkaus erected on the river bank. The Sadong band was in evidence and performed untiringly throughout the morning. A langkau especially erected for; the Chinese was well patronised and sounds of revelry were heard issuing from that quarter.
   The boatraces were paddled off in record time, finishing at noon, when the crowd dispersed for refreshment.
   The Europeans were royally lunched at the Residency and thereafter proceeded to the padang adjoining where land sports were held.
   All of the twenty-three events were keenly contested with the exception of the 100 yards race for Tamils, who happened at the time to be otherwise employed endeavouring to create a drought in the bazaar. The obstacle race caused no end of amusement.
   The native officers race was won by a thorough sportsman.
   The Europeans race, biting a swinging orange off a string and carrying in the mouth to the winning post created intense delight among the onlookers and was eventually won by the man with the largest mouth.
   The football match, Wharf v: Colliery was unfortunately brought to an early end by the bursting of the bladder. Neither side had scored.
   Great credit is due to the Resident Mr. H. H. Kortright and to Mr. Chia Muk Kim for their untiring energy and the successful way in which they reeled off’ a lengthy programme.

     It was thought that the Lang Menyambar losing two paddles in this race and the Patri Simunjan one that a closer race might have resulted, but the first named boat is a new one and obviously far faster than any other boat here and she again won easily. The order of the 2nd and 3rd however was reversed and Than San after a great effort just beat Patri Simunjan.

   The out-put of coal produced by the mines during the month was 1,931½ tons, 465 tons of which was consumed by our boilers and 1,466½ tons delivered to the wharf for export.
   The shipments for the month were: —

 ,,       ,,        The Sarawak Steamship ...
 ,,	 „        The British Malaysian

   His Highness very kindly honoured us with a visit to the Collieries on the 18th.	.
   The fall in No. 8 mine was cleared and the retaining walls completed by the 20th. This mine began to produce coal on the 22nd.
   No. 9 and the upper seam mines produced very well, the disturbance in the east side workings of the latter mines was driven through a distance of thirty-six feet. It was unnecessary to drive through any further as it had proved to be a denudation covering a large area. Mining operations on this side were therefore abandoned and work was commenced on the large coal pillar which had been reserved on the west side.
   Everything went well in the mechanical department and the usual work of repairing and filling in of the subsided river-bank at the wharf was carried out.
   The rainfall for the month was 10'96 inches.

MIRI.
January.
   On my return from home furlough I took over from Mr. Skrine who returned to Limbang.
   On the 9th two Chinese gardeners were found murdered at Pujut : one Chan See was suspected of being the culprit and duly arrested. Later Chan See was tried for murder and the jury returned a verdict of guilty the minutes of the case being forwarded to His Highness the Rajah for sentence to be passed. Other Court cases were of the usual description ami unworthy of special note.
   The Miri Maru which had been lying idle since her purchase was dry docked and a thorough overhaul and repair commenced: It is hoped to have her in commission by the end of next month.
   Two Chinese lunatics are being kept in the jail compound under observation, and if their condition does not improve they will have to be sent to Kuching for treatment.
   T. K. Bangun of Bakam reports that one Amut was taken by a crocodile while fording the Sg. Tukan at its mouth on the beach : Half the unfortunate man’s body has been recovered, but as yet they have been unsuccessful in catching the beast. This stream like several others is, and has been for years, crossed at the same spot every day, as it is on the main route between Miri, Bakam and Sibuti.
   The s. y. Zahora called to take Messrs. McAlpine and Smart to Kuching in connection with the water pipe repairs, and returned with them again on the 16th. H. M. S. Marzion from Singapore called
on private business on the 4th instant. The Straits Steamship Company vessels Suddhadib. Selangor, Kajang. each called en route to and from Singapore.
The m. s. Nerite cleared with 1,845 tons benzine and 998 tons fuel oil. By the s. s. Kajang on the 31st. 860 piculs of jungle produce were shipped to Singapore by the Baram and Miri Chinese, and it is hoped that similar quantities will now be regularly exported.
   Mr. and Mrs. Bromfield and child, who were leaving Sarawak, were passengers by the s. s. Kajang
   The prisoners were employed on roads and general up-keep and assisted in docking the Miri Maru.
   The rainfall amounted to 15'51 inches and the trade returns show as follows:—
     Imports.   Exports.Miri     $46,928   $150,727Niah       4,689             307Sibuti       3,407          3,303     $55,024   $151,387February.
   While bathing in the river at Lutong a coolie became the victim of a crocodile. Some remains of his body were subsequently recovered: and that only with difficulty as the crocodile repeatedly attacked the partv. The usual trap was set and a beast measuring 17 feet and 6 inches was caught, but no human remains were found.
   The water supply question having again arisen I took Mr Otway, Civil Engineer of Messrs. Anglo- Haxon Petroleum Company, to Sungei Seritam reservoir, where he was surprised to find such an abundance of water going to waste and further the extent to which the capacity of the reservoir could be so easily increased.
   Repairs to the motor lighter Miri Maru were completed and she is now in commission and doing good work. It is found necessary to install a compressed air cylinder to facilitate starting. This is now being done and- will be completed shortly.
   Chinese New Year's Day on the 20th was observed as a public holiday.
   Captain Andreini came from Baram on the 23rd instant in order to get to Kuching to obtain permission to go to Japan on private business.
   The Honble. the Resident and Mrs. Douglas left on a visit to Baram on the 26th. The s. 1. La Follette brought a considerable amount of cargo from Baram for shipment to Kuching by the s. s.

February.
   By appointment with H. B. M.'s Resident I went over to Brunei on the 4th to sign a new agreement relating to the Pandaruan and district, the principal clauses in which are that the sole rights over the true left bank are vested in the Sarawak Government and over the true right bank in the Brunei Government, or in other words the Pandaruan river becomes the boundary between the Limbang and Tamburong districts.
   On my way to Brunei I met the s. s. L'Aubaine coming up the river with Mr. W. F. de V. Skrine on board. He transhipped into the m. l. Damit and came on to Brunei with me.
   We returned from Brunei on the morning of the 5th and left for Lawns shortly afterwards by the s. s. L'A ubaine. Mr. Skrine remained at Lawas and I returned here on the 10th.
   The 20th being Chinese New Year a salute of 7 guns was wired from the fort in the morning and the day observed as a holiday.
   The s. l. Peter Duff with Mr. and Mis. Kenneth Watson and Mr. Listerman on board called here on the 23rd to load a cargo of sago for Labuan.
   I was absent at Brooketon from the 25th until the end of the month.
   The order increasing the price of opium to eight dollar a tahil was put in force here on the 27th and that doubling the export duties on the 28th.
   There was no steamer from Kuching during the month H. H. S. Y. Zahora dropped mails at Brooketon on the 19th.
