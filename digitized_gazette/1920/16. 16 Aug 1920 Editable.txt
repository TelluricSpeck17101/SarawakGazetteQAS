   WE note that His Highness the Rajah has appointed the Resident of the 1st. Division and the Treasurer or the officers Acting in those capacities as his Deputies to administer the Government of the State during His Highness’ absence.
  We understand that Mr. A. B. Ward is leaving England at the end of August and may be expected in Sarawak about the end of September.

On Church Going.
   The Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak has been paying one of hie periodical visits to Borneo and we were all very pleased to see him and Mrs. Danson again. The Bishop’s stay has been prolonged owing to the fact that there is no resident padre in Sandakan at the moment. The duty and other Church work there have been taken and carried out for some weeks by the Bishop for which the residents ought to feel very grateful. It is, however, rumoured that the Bishop is rather disappointed at the poor attendance at the various services, and it

is much to be hoped that the residents will show their appreciation of the Bishop’s action, in filling the temporary gap, by attending Church more frequently and in greater numbers in future.

  OWING to lack of space we are unable to publish a long list of donations which have been received for The Rajah Charles Brooke Memorial Fund. These will appear in our next issue.

  MADAM Cho Kim the mother of Messrs. Boon Siew, Kheng Watt, Kheng Chiang and Kheng Hong passed away at 10.30 on Friday night the 6th. instant at the residence of her son Kheng Chiang. The funeral took place at 10 A.M on Monday the 9th. instant. The deceased is 63 years of age and she leaves behind four sons and daughter-in-laws, three daughters and son-in-laws, 25 grand children and three great grandchildren to mourn for her. 

A CURIOUS INCIDENT.

  ON the night of the 11th. instant following a game of Bowls at the Sarawak Club and during a small argument as to the method of arranging handicaps, there suddenly appeared from under the seat, in the alley, a young cobra of about two feet in length closely followed by a large offensive looking scorpion. Both were despatched for their impudence in interfering with a matter which did not in the least concern them, but which evidently, either soothed or enticed them out for a hearing, or on the other hand, to act in a painful manner as arbitrators!
  Scorpions are not uncommon in the alley, but two venomous reptiles both appearing together is distinctly peculiar and unpleasant, and oddly enough the occurrence has nothing to do with ’‘Race-week’’ as some suspicious readers might be inclined to suspect!!
ULAR TEDONG (deceased.)
THE S. S. Kuching arrived from Singapore on the 1st. Passengers by her were Messrs. J. W. Evans, L. K. L. Chan. Tan Siow Whye, Yeo Kim Tam, Koh Tiam Lye and Mr. and Mrs. C. Hoong Sze.

THE p. s. Adeh arrived from the North on the 4th. with the Revd. Father Dine from Brooketon

THE p. s. Adeh sailed for the North on the 8th. with Mr. E. O. Bruce for Oya, Mr. S. H. Lawrence for Brooketon, Mr. W. Cotterill for  Miri and Mr. C. D. Adams for Baram via Miri.

Clippings.
   A correspondent in Java writes to a home paper: The latest Japanese trick has just come to light. On all the match-boxes here is printed. “Manufactured in Sweden.” The matches are of a very inferior quality, and people set to work to find out. Result: There is a village in Japan which is now called " Sweden,” and there the match factory has been established!—(S. T.)
   This spiritualism business has at least one advantage, in these N.C.L. days. A man may say to his wife's visiting mother: "Instead of going to theatre to-night, mother dear, wouldn't you like to spend the evening with our deceased relatives? ”—S. T.) 
   	
   
Departure of His Highness the Rajah
.
   His Highness the Rajah left Sarawak by the Kuching on the 15th. instant. A heavy storm came on just before the ship was due to sail but this did not prevent a large company both Europeans and natives from assembling to wish him farewell and bon voyage. His Highness had not intended, to leave before September but found it necessary to leave earlier in order to catch his boat Home from Rangoon. We understand his two children are meeting him in Singapore and that they are all going Home by a Bibby line boat from Rangoon. We wish His Highness the best of luck and a speedy return.

The Late Tuanku Mansor.

   We regret to announce the death of Tuanku Mansor at the age of 75. He was the son of Tuanku Mahsen who married Datu Temunggong's sister Dayang Zabedah. Tuanku Mahsen was living at Siniawan when the small-pox epidemic broke out in that village and was ordered by His Highness the late Rajah to look after the people. Later when
His Highness himself was attacked by the small-pox Tuanku Mahsen nursed and cured him. Tuanku Mansor served as Government vaccinator in Kuching and the outstations for six years after which he went to Pontianak where be married and lived for 19 years. Later on his return he was appointed
Tua Kampong of Matang and also Government vaccinator in Kuching and outstations in which capacity he has served for the last 17 years up till the time of his death.

“Good Wages” Offered to Sound Sleepers.
   This surprising advertisement appeared the other
day in the Times Personal Column :—
   Required, healthy person able to sleep during the day, no work, but good sleeper essential; good wages; references, followed by the name, of the Shetland United Knitters, Rosebery Avenue, E. C. It was not, as probably most readers believed, a joke or a hoax. Mr. Abel-Harry who speaks on behalf of the knitters, assures us that the advertisement is perfectly genuine, and that persons are wanted who can sleep for five or six hours during the day to demonstrate that with a single garment of pure hand-spun Shetland wool covering them it is impossible to feel or take cold.
   As to the prospect of finding healthy persons able to sleep, as it is proposed they shall sleep during the day in exhibition rooms in various parts of the country, Mr. Abel-Harry is very hopeful. When he was an officer in the Army he noticed that men often slept for several hours after a route march, and he believes that there are many persons who, by rising early in the morning and taking a few hours’ vigorous exercise—either rowing, cycling, or walking—will be able to sleep soundly at his exhibitions from eleven o'clock till four every day. Already some two hundred men and women, including a number of ex-officers, have offered to sleep for as many hours every day as the Shetland knitters wish.—(S. T.)

185	THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, AUGUST 16, 1920.
UPPER SARAWAK.
                       BAU AND PAKU.
July.
   There have been lew cases of any importance before the Courts during the month. A Chinese who was convicted of theft for the third time was sentenced to a term of imprisonment and to six cuts with the rattan.
   Another Chinese found living amongst Dayaks was convicted of assault and was also found guilty of swindling the Dayaks by selling them charms, etc.
   On the 4th. a pepper thief, who was being escorted from Tondong to Bau by a Sikh policeman, managed to escape after knocking the policeman into a ditch. This man was handcuffed at the time, and has not yet been re-arrested. The escorting P. C. is old and of no practical use. His eyesight is also affected.
   I had intended to remove the police from Paku. but in consequence of representations by planters there, I have postponed doing this for the time being. The Tondong police guard have been transferred to Paku, as that place is of no great importance, while a guard of younger and more capable men has gone to Tondong.
   One of the Siniawan police was seized by a crocodile. By holding on to the landing stage he was able to avoid being dragged under until help came. He was sent to Kuching hospital, his leg being badly torn. A few days before this a Chinaman had been seized, but got away practically unharmed.
   The mail man reported that he was stopped and questioned on the Buan road while bringing the mail after dark from Buso to Bau. He asserts that the men who stopped him had blackened their faces and carried large sticks. On his asserting that he believed there to be nothing of value in the mail he was allowed to proceed. I rather doubt this story.
   In consequence of the amount of grumbling going on I reverted to the old system of selling rice on the 8th. instant, and was still carrying on with this system at the end of the month.
   Numbers of Dayaks from different parts of the district have paid in their tax for 1920, and very little is now outstanding.
   The Grogo Dayaks have worked and brought in soft wood for repairs to Government buildings.
   One section of the new police barracks has been completed and is now occupied
   I was in Kuching from the 21st. to the 26th. instant.
   The news of the death of the Manager of Bau mine, Mr. J. S. Geikie, was received here on the 24th. with the greatest sorrow by all classes.
   Mr. Geikie was exceedingly popular with those who had any dealings with him, and was respected by natives and Chinese throughout the district.
   His loss will be most severely felt, not only by the small European community, but by all with whom he came into contact.
   During the time Mr. Geikie has been Manager at Bau the Government officers stationed there have received the most valuable assistance from him in every way, and in their official dealings with Mr. Geikie have invariably met with the utmost courtesy and consideration
H. L. OWEN.
District Officer.
MUKAH.
July.
   There were several cases in Court. Juhar was sentenced to 9 months R. I. for theft, Ah Chong 6 months R. I., Dinoh 4 months R. I. Seng Tee one year R. I. for swindling.
   A light bridge consisting entirely of nibong was thrown over the old Mukah river close to the mouth by the kampong people. A continuation of the road leading from the fort to this bridge was put in hand by the prisoners.
   An auxiliary motor schooner the Teck Lee of 83 tons burthen with 4 Cylinder Parsons engine entered on the 19th. The voyage from Kuching took but 31 hours. It is to be hoped that other sago traders will follow suit, as a considerable time is saved both in the entering and clearing of this river.
   There has been a lot of sickness about here and at Balingean. In the Titian there were several cases of chicken pox.
   The weather has been very hot during the month. Several fires were started which owing to carelessness caused destruction in some rubber gardens.
   14 vessels entered and 15 cleared.
   The chief exports were:—
1920.	1919.
    Raw sago	276 koyans	409 koyans
    Jelutong	53   piculs	880 piculs

BROOKETON COLLIERY.

June.
   The gross out-put of coal from the mines was 1,945 tons, 472.5 tons was consumed by our boilers and the balance 1,472.5 tons sent to wharf.
   Shipments amounted to 1,698 tons, made up as follows: —
      To Labuan ...	... 1,046 tons
      S. S. Redang, Singapore ...	525
      P. S. Adeh, etc.	...	127
Total 1,698 tons

   The balance of coal in stock at the end of the month was 345.5 tons.
   Sales at Brooketon amounted to 652 tons and at Labuan to 944 tons.
   Good progress was made in the main deep of the North Drive mine and a new level turned. Work at the mines was greatly disorganized during the latter half of the month owing to an epidemic of influenza amongst the coolies. Chinese and Malays, about 40% of whom caught the complaint.
   The usual work of cleaning boilers and overhauling machinery was done in the early part of the month and everything went smoothly in this department.
   The s.l. L'Aubaine's boiler was cleaned and engine overhauled. A number of leaking tubes were also attended to.
   Both lighters were beached for repairs during the month.
   The rainfall at Brooketon Mines for the month was 5'65 inches.

PROVISIONS.
    WE beg to announce that we have recently been appointed Sole Agents in Sarawak, Brunei and British North Borneo for Messrs, Joseph Travers & Sons, Limited, proprietors of the well-known “SHIP” and “SIGNAL” brands of TINNED PROVISIONS and are now ready to commence business on whole- sale lines.
    It is still impossible to obtain adequate supplies from England and the Colonies but the situation becomes easier week by week and we hope shortly to be able to meet all demands.
    We. shall be pleased to send price lists on application.
