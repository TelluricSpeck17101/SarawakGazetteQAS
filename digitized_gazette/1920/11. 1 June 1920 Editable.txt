   THE S. S. Kuching arrived from Singapore on  the 30th. Her passengers included Messrs, J. R. Barnes, W. H. Geikie, McGowan and W. A. Chapman.
  
  Ma. Ivan Jones has kindly presented a cup for Mens Singles Tennis (handicap) at the Sarawak Club. There are a good number of entries and the cup will be keenly contested.
  We hear that tickets for the Derby Sweep are in great demand and about $3,000 has been collected up to the time of going to press.
   OUR readers will note with interest that the price of ice is going up with the approach of the hot season.
   WE understand that His Highness the Rajah and party had a very pleasant trip to Lundu at Whitsun, in spite of the weather, which it is believed was colder than it has been for many years.
   WE are indebted to the Superintendent of Police for the following information with regard to forged $5 notes referred to in our last issue. “There is a grave error, by which these notes can be distinguished at first glance, the tops of the letters “ETTLE " in the word ‘ “Settlements” are joined together and very badly smudged.
   THE following letter has been received from the British County Homestead Association. Subscriptions should be forwarded to Major O. C. Magniac and David Fell, Esq., Joint Hon. Treasurers, 2 Carlton Chambers, 4 Regent Street, London, S. W. 1.
DEAR SIR,
     It may seem a bold thing to ask help of our “Over-sea Friends” to settle on the soil of the Old  Country, the ex-service men, for whom your own broad acres are loudly calling!
   But we are only asking what will turn out to be a  mutual benefit both to the Mother Country and her Daughter Nations.
   This appeal is only for our “War-broken” men, who are not fit to transplant to new Countries. Most of them have families, and the training of the Fathers and their settlement in this Country will give the Children the up-bringing and the love for life on the soil that will fit them for, and make them respond to the ” Over-seas ” call in later years, when the little holding becomes too small for them. This surplus product of the Old Country soil makes the best type of Colonist!
   Our first thoughts are for these disabled men. Their one desire is to have a little bit of the Land- they-bled-for, and to live out the remainder of their broken life on it! Can you blame them? It may be sentiment, but it is a sentiment worth fostering! In spite of all that you are doing for the War-wrecked of your own land, will you help us to realise for them these dream-homes of the heroes of the Old Grey Mother ?
   We would have liked to have done it all without troubling you, but these homes will be all the dearer, when they know that their brothers overseas joined hands to provide them!
   The world owes a debt of gratitude to these men
it can never repay! The dead we cannot reward except in grateful memory! But these—the half- dead offer us the grandest opportunity!
Yours faithfully,
                  ALICE OLIPHUNT MURRAY.

   WE regret that, there was an error in the details of Mr. Baring-Gould's Service given in our last issue.
  He was appointed Resident 2nd Class in 1902 and Resident 2nd Class Sibu in 1908.
   WE have received an appeal from the Comité de Souscription au Monument a la Mémoir de L’ Aviateur Jules Védrines.
  It will be remembered that the famous Aviator Jules Védrines lost his life flying. He has left an old mother aged 71 a wife and four small children and it is in order to raise money for the support of these, that the pilot Etienne Poulet has undertaken, without any official help, to attempt the flight from Paris to Australia.
  To quote the words of the appeal those of our readers, who desire to associate themselves with the grand and beautiful oeuvre, can address their share to the Treasurer Mr. G. Labastie, 7 Place de la Bastile, Paris IV. (France).

         Notes and Comments.
—?—
   It is computed that if all the coal elsewhere on the globe were to go up in smoke and flame tomorrow the coal beds of Shansi alone would be able to supply all the needs of the world consumption, not for several hundred, but for several hundred thousand years. We are not responsible for this estimate, nor for the forcible supposition that precedes it. They represent the utterance of Professor Murdoch of the Sydney University, embodied in an interesting lecture recently delivered by him with the somewhat spacious title of “Japan, China and India.’ His remarks, however, bear out the opinions expressed in this journal from time to time when advocating increased attention to the development of China. The greatest Chinese coalfield lies in the province of Shansi. It is 30,000 square miles in extent. The coal is of superior quality, being bituminous on the west and anthracite in the east. Not so very long ago coal could be bad at a shilling a ton at the pit’s month in Shansi. Coal is, of course, found in every province in China, and a recent estimate made the coal measures of the Chinese Republic 417,000 square miles. Kaiping, north of Peking, is the oldest mine, but those now in the hands of the Japanese in Manchuria are the most productive, and for some considerable time have been sending their output as far as Valparaiso. But immense as is the direct value to China of her coal deposits, such value can only be justly estimated when the indirect effect of these deposits is considered. Authorities state, or admit where they do not assert, that in the future the centres of the world's industries will tend to concentrate on those countries richest in fuel resources. Viewed from this standpoint, we see how great are the industrial possibilities before the Chinese Republic.
   The world rationing of timber and the need for international co-operation in conserving available supplies have become mutters of very great importance. in view; of the industrial, development which now characterises so many countries. Industrial activity augments the consumption of timber. Because of such activity many countries which formerly exported timber are now importers. It is in this connection that the matter directly concerns the Far East, Potentially, if not actually, China exhibits a greater degree of industrial development than any other country in the world, and to-day China imports timber. Hitherto Java has been a self-supporting country, but with a further increase in her population she will be unable to satisfy her own requirements. The timber-exporting countries in the Far East are India, including Burmah, Ceylon, Siam, Indo-China, the Malay Peninsular. Sumatra, the Celebes, Borneo, the Philippine Islands, Forniosa, and Japan. Borneo, the Celebes and Philippines export timber chiefly to China. In the Philippines there are 38,000,000 acres of virgin and secondary forests capable of being used, and this is one of the few remaining forest resources of the Far East. Japan, with further industrial development, will probably cease to be a timber-exporting country. Granting the great resources of Africa, North and South America and Russia, the outlook is serious, in view of the increasing demand. The remedy is, of course to be found in reforestation, and every endeavour should be made throughout the Far East to forward the schemes in hand or contemplated regarding this important work. The world, it has been said, is living on its wood capital. Timber comes from two sources, that which has grown up unplanted
or untended by man, and that derived from trees or forests which have been planted by the present or previous generation. Only small quantities are at present obtained from the latter class. Existing schemes for reforestation by no means counterbalance the acreage cut down, and we are gradually using up the world’s accumulated growth of timber. Despite the fact that the produce from new plantations will not be ready for the market for at least fifty years, the prospects which reafforestation presents are, when all advantages are considered, highly remunerative, and the industry clearly calls for much greater exploitation.—( L. & C. Express.)

SADONG COLLIERY.
April.
   The gross out-put produced by the mines was 1,739—02 tons, 450 tons of this was consumed by our boilers and 1,289-02 tons delivered to the wharf.
   The shipments for the month were:-
   The Kuching Municipality	...   274-00 tons
   Messrs: The Borneo Company, Kuching  452-12   ,,
         ,,         ,,   Sarawak Steamship. Co.       455-12   ,          ,,         ,,   Soon Seng A Co.. Sibu	     150-00 ,,
    The Sibu station ...	...   100-00 ..
Total shipments 1,432-04 tons
   There was no stock balance on the wharf at the end of the month.
   No. 8 and 9 mines produced fairly well, while a good and regular out-put was obtained from the upper seam.
   Two old Chinese lines and eleven Malay houses were dismantled during the month and the new Mian houses were occupied.
   Everything went well in the mechanical department. A gang of ten prisoners arrived from Sibu to work timber on the 7th and by the end of the month, two of them had been released on the termination of their sentences.
   Two shipments of round and converted timber were shipped for the Public Works Department Kuching during the month, on the 14th. aud 19th. respectively.
   A good deal of rubbish was dumped on the riverbank and the usual repairs carried out at the wharf.
   There was a great shortage of coal carriers and most of the coaling vessels had to be loaded with Chinese labour from the mines, as the usual Malay carriers were away harvesting their padi crop.
   A general protest was made by the mine inhabitants against the excessive prices charged for provisions by the bazaar traders. This grievance proved to be well-founded, as the prices not only went up with the arrival of the bandongs once a fortnight with fresh supplies, but an interval rise of a cent or two on certain articles had at last almost become a matter of daily occurrence.
   A list of these prices was submitted to Mr Kortright the local Food Control Officer, who kindly took the matter up at once, with the result, that prices were considerably reduced all round.
   The rainfall for the month was 10'10 inches.

SIMANGGANG.
—?—
April.
   On the 3rd 1 accompanied Mr. Page-Turner to Engklili and Marup returning on the 5th. During our visit a number of pepper gardens were inspected and the vines seemed particularly well kept. Arrangements were made for all the Chinese, to farm this year. A start has at last been made on the erection of the new bilian-atap bazaar at Engklili. The 2nd. and 5th. being Good Friday and Easter Monday. Government offices were closed.
   Tenders for the Simanggang birds’-nests farms were opened on the 7th.; and Chop Chiap Heng's of $64 per annum accepted. These birds-nests come from caves in the Klingkang. Dayaks who pay tax at Lingga also collect from caves close by in the Klingkang range, and the Lingga birds’-nest  farms rental is $982 per annum, but this is the first time there bus been a farm here. The Simanggang farmer and those selling to him, who must only be Dayaks paying tax here, have been warned not to interfere with the Lingga farmers rights. On the 7th. with all the Chinese shop-keepers, I measured out land tor their farms this next year on the Sabu road. Preliminary clearing there of has already started: and all seem most anxious to wake the venture a success. A large Chinese tea yang of about sixty performers, brought in by Seng Kim. arrived on the 8th. and has since been giving performances here. This led to an influx of food-hawkers and gamblers; but there has been no appreciable increase in crime, though the prices of all foodstuffs continue to rise.
   I took over the affaiis of the station on the 12th. and Mr. Page-Turner left for Lingga on the 14th., sailing from there for Kuching next day on furlough $9,037 in notes was remitted to the Kuching Treasury by this opportunity. Adin and other Dayaks in the lower Skrang brought down Garit of his house on the 17th. for the attempted murder of his wife and child the previous night. I held a preliminary enquiry into this, and Mr. Dick left at once for the house accompanied by Abang Haji Buasan. Mr. Dick returned the same night and reported the woman and child were very badly cut about, the mother having twelve wounds, and the infant two. These were attended to by Mr. Dick, and have since been dressed twice by a clerk sent up from here. Milk has also been supplied for the child; and I am glad to say there appears to be a good chance of their recovery, which was not expected at first. Garit has been remanded until such rime as his wife Umbar is able to appear before the Court. There appears to have been no motive whatsoever for the crime.
   Having handed over to Mr. Dick, I left for Sabuyow early on the 18th., accompanied by Datu Haji Tamin, Abang Dul, Abang Omar and Draup, arriving there the same evening. A few trifling cases were disposed of the next morning. A charge brought against a Dayak woman Munah was adjourned for settlement on my return to Simanggang. Having held an enquiry into his conduct, I ordered Abang Madaut, the Native Officer of Sabuyow, to proceed to Simanggaug and do duty there pending further instructions from His Highness the Rajah, to whom this matter has been reported under separate cover. Abang Omar was temporarily appointed Native Officer at Sabuyow in place of Abang Madaut, from whom he took over the same day.
   Abang Dul and Draup then proceeded to the ulu Sabuyow to arrange for the collection of the abandoned bilian, which has reverted to Government in accordance with His Highness the Rajah’s orders.
   I left for Kabong at 5 a. m. on the 20th., accompanied by Datu Haji Tamin, arriving there in five
hours, which was the best trip we made in a succession of very long and tiresome journeys. The lack of a launch is more acutely felt than ever on these
visits to the outstations of the 2nd. Division. Of the whole three weeks away, nine days were spent in boats. There were no cases of any importance at Kabong except a charge brought by one Jaoyah (f) against her husband Mun and a bazaar Chinaman Chua Beng Tek, which was adjourned till my return from up-river.
   Permission was given to Malays to open a shop at Nyabor next to where the Chinaman's present shop is. This is rather an interesting experiment. There being only one shop-keeper, he apparently charges the people here, who are some distance off any bazaar, exhorbitant prices. The kampong Malays have accordingly formed a company, even the youth and beauty of the village putting in capital, I am told ; and they hope to make it a profitable, as well an economical, concern for themselves. With some experience of the Malay idea of accounts, I fear there, is more likelihood of it developing into a co-operative “sell help” society till the original capital is exhausted to the ultimate benefit of the smallest share-holder.
   After checking the Government cash and deposits,
I left for Roban on the 22nd., reaching this station at 8 p. m. Court was held next day, and numerous cases disposed of. Chuli was fined 2 pikuls for causing grievous hurt to another Dayak, and the gun concerned in the case confiscated ; Chuli paying another $25 compensation to the injured man. A charge against a Dayak woman. Rapid, was adjourned for evidence to be obtained from the Batang Rejang. Changgan. a Dayak, was fined $115 for felling gutta nan trees. Having settled the outstanding cases early next morning, I left for Kabong at 9.30 a. m., stopping at Sessang on the way, where permission was granted for another shop to be erected opposite the present ones. Kabong was reached at 6 p. m. and I left for Saratok the same night at 2 a. m., not arriving there, till 10 a. m. Crowds of Dayaks had come down here, and there were a great number of cases awaiting settlement. This is in spite of the fact that the two Native Officers in the Krian, Abang Bujang and Abang Abu-Talip, are most capable men ; a large amount of less important litigation had already been settled by them—besides that disposed of by the Dayak Penghulus—and there was not a single appeal against any of their decisions. The appointment of a European Officer to Saratok, it is hoped, will not be overlooked so soon as there are sufficient officers to man the more important outstations. All Officer stationed here could superintend the Rimbas, both Pusa and Debak being less than six hours walk away, and of course Kabong and Roban: Saratok being centrally situated for all these substations. The far greater proportion - of the revenue of the 2nd. Division is derived from these places; and, with the present facilities they cannot be given adequate supervision. Again the lack of a launch is felt. Simanggang, with the present depleted European staff, cannot be left for long at a time; and the large Malay and Dayak population, besides the increasing number of Chinese especially in the Upper Roban and Ibus, call for more attention. Among the cases settled which call for mention were following:—
   Jebin sentenced to six months imprisonment for culpable homicide in causing the death of another Dayak by his pig trap, and to pay $100 pati nyawa to relatives of deceased. Jebin's trap was placed in a most dangerous position right on the river bank at the foot of an engkabang tree. Kim Chong Teng alias Ah Maw (Liu Chin), two years for criminal breach of trust; aiding and abetting burglary; and

absconding in debt. Lee Tai Siew (Liu Cbiu) three years for housebreaking, absconding in debt, and returning to the 2nd. Division after banishment; Tun Ah Paw (Liu Chin), six months for aiding and abetting theft, and absconding in debt. Another Liu Chiu, who assisted these men to abscond, was fined. Lee Tai Siew, who has several prior convictions against mm while living at Sabu, will be deported to Kuching on termination of his sentence with a recommendation that he be banished from Sarawak. Kim Chong Teng alias Ah Maw and Lee Tai Siew escaped from custody on the 27th, owing to the gross carelessness of P. C. Bujang Mos. Lee Tai Siew was recaptured by Dayaks the same evening and received the usual punishment. Kim Chong Teng is still at large. Again, but for the stupidity of P. C. Bujang Mos, he would have been caught at Ibus whither he run from Roban. A Liu Chiu who assisted him hits been arrested, and is on detention pending Kim Chong Teng's recapture, to effect which P. C. Bujang Mos was ordered to Sarikei with a warrant and letter to the Court writer, and instructions not to return till the man had been in found, as he is reported to be in Sarih or Sarikei. These men belong to the secret society which used to exert such an influence in Roban. The majority of the members have fled to the less supervised districts of the Lower Rejang, since action taken against some of them last year at Reban. Abang Majit of Pusa and Daji (Dayak) were sentenced to three months and six weeks imprisonment respectively for offering bribes to Government officials. The minutes of the case against Abaug Majit were forwarded under separate cover to His Highness the Rajah. Sumang of Nanga Wak, Julan. was fined two pikuls for causing grievous hurt to a Krian Dayak by his pig trap, half the fine going as compensation lo the injured person. Lui, Dayak, was fined three and Niah (f) 1½ piculs for incest, the woman's fine going to plasi menoa. Sim Sek sentenced to six mouths for theft and escaping from custody. A peculiar case of incest according to Dayak adat was adjourned for consultation with the Batang Lupar chiefs, the parties concerned being a man and the divorced wife of his uncle, the latter being still alive and there having been five children of their marriage still living with the woman. There were numerous land eases and gutta rian pulau disputes : a number having to be further adjourned for examination on the spot. The Babang Dayaks yet again appeared in Court over land squabbles. Heavy pledges were demanded from all the head men concerned. These will be retained indefinitely; and, it is hoped, put a stop to this litigation, which is simply raked up in a spirit of petty revenge for some other quarrel. I was still at Saratok at the end of the month. Arrangements were made at Kabong, Roban and Saratok for all the Chinese to farm this year. The Malays have also been warned that they must plant sufficient padi this year for their requirements, instead of relying on the Dayak crop. Reports of the latter
are good for all bill districts, but the swamp padi seems to have suffered a lot from various pests. A number of Dayaks and Malays took out permits to fell jungle for sago; and I had several applications for permission to import buffaloes for farming. At Simanggang before my departure, Sam Heng was fined $250 for breach of rice regulations. Sampang, a Balau Dayak was sentenced to eighteen months R. I. on three charges of theft from jelutong huts. Lenggai, a Dayak-Chinese, from Dor, was forwarded in custody to Kuching under suspicion of insanity. Dayang Kadar, wife of Tuanku Bujang. and daughter of the late Abang Arip died on the 2nd.
  The masons started cementing below the hospital on the 13th. The gravel and sand required are greatly in excess of the quantities estimated, and prisoners

have been employed in getting same from the Skrang and Engkili, where the Batang Ai Dayaks have been bringing in supplies. Other Dayaks have been bringing in same here for tobacco. Otherwise the prisoners have berm on the usual road work, clearing the plan, and preparing the Government buildings for the annual whitewashing.
    Mr. Dick reports as follows during my absence:- 
    A Dayak woman from Sabu received a severe wound on her forehead inflicted with a parang by her
son, while her Chinese husband held her. The Chinaman, Ah Lon, and his son were remanded and the woman's wound medically treated. It appears a number of oranges have been stolen from the Government plantation, but the thief has not been traced. Chula, an ex-prisoner just released, was arrested for theft in the bazaar.
    Lubok Antu. -The upper barracks are nearing completion, and the outside fence has been placed in the new position. The harvest is reported to have been a record one in the Ulu Ai. There are also reports of a good engkabang crop, but the Dayaks refuse to part with same for notes.
    Saribas.- Abang Indut and Penghulu Empati have been employed marking off the newly formed lands in the main river, as mentioned in the March report.

   General. -Good Friday and Easter Monday being public holidays, the offices were closed.
On the 4th. Mr. H. L. Owen arrived from Mukah and the next day we proceeded to Dalat where the Chinese community gave a dinner in his honour, as did those at Oya on the following day when we returned.
   On Friday, the 9th. s. l. Chamois called off the kuala at 2 p. m.. Mr. H. L Owen. Rev Father Mulder, Brother Simon and myself embarking for Mukah. I returned next day.
   Visited Dalat again on the 13th. for 4 days, and during my stay, the local Chinese made a deputation requesting the continuation of the lottery for another month, but this I refused to allow.
   On the 22nd. a wreck was reported at Mukah.
   Leaving on the 25th. for Sibu, via Dalat, I was still away at the end of the month.
   Court. —A Melanau named Anut was sentenced on the 15th. to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for manslaughter, having assaulted and fatally injured his wife Enak, then 8 months pregnant, in a most brutal manner. Brahim and his wife Ujan also, were given 2 years R. I. and fined $l00 each for being accessories to the act, in that they took no steps to prevent Anut nor did they attempt to help Enak although living in the same house and being witnesses of the whole affair.
   A man named Bujnng was sentenced to 3 years hard labour for burglary.

but I am unable as yet to report upon the harvest. Only Kampong Snau having finished. The price of rice is still $1.60 per gantang and about 1,118 gantangs were sold during the month from the Oya Government Rice Depot.
   P. W. D., etc.—Owing to the gang of prisoners being small, work far a-field has been impracticable, and they have been employed in the near vicinity of the Court house and Government grounds; roads, however, are in a very satisfactory condition on the whole, and do not need much attention just now. Paid labour is still difficult to obtain.
   Trade.: —While in Dalat on the 14th. I arranged to have proper trade returns kept there in future, as formerly no record of Dalat direct trade has been kept, and the Oya district returns have therefore been inaccurate.
   Shipping- Fifteen schooners and three steamers arrived, while thirteen schooners and three steamers cleared.

TRUSAN
February.
   I arrived from Lawas via the overland route on the 17th. accompanied by Mr. J. P. Baird, who came over to try and obtain some padi for the Company’s employees, and Datu Haji Halil.
   The following day I took over charge of the district from Datu Haji Halil; and checked the cash and accounts from the 1st. January, 1920.
   All the Government employees were informed, that now native rice is obtainable, rice rationing will cease from the 1st. March.

   A great many claims for damage done to padi by buffaloes were dealt with; this damaging of padi is


    
due tn the buffalo owners failing to keep the buffalo fences, fixed by Government in 1913, in repair.
    I left for Sundar on the 19th. to take over and check the accounts and cash, I regret to report however that the accounts were not well kept. I accordingly warned the clerk to be more careful in future.

   Datu Haji Halil having arrived at Sundar by boat on the 13th. I returned to Lawas with him a few days later.
   Throughout the month the natives were busy with the harvest, they however fear the crop will be poor on account of the damage done by rats.

A FOOTBAI.LER ON CYCLING.
   Jesse Pennington, the famous footballer and captain of the English team against Wales, is an all-round athlete and a great believer in the value of the bicycle for training. “It is a wise footballer." he says, "who keeps himself in good condition through the summer and I can speak from experience when I say that there is no better way of keeping fit than to ride a Raleigh through both summer and winter. The splendid reliability and easy running of the Raleigh make it particularly a sportman’s bicycle, and it combines pleasure and exercise in the most delightful way.” It will be remembered that Alfred Felton, the sculling champion of the world, did the whole of his training on a Raleigh prior to his defeat of Barry, and now the English football captain confirms the great rowing man’s experience.
