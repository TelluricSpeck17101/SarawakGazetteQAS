   MR. W. F. de.V. Skrine has been granted special leave to Europe on urgent private affairs, and leaves early in June. We understand that Mr. H. H. Kortright, District | Officer, Bintulu, will take over his duties meanwhile.


136	THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, JUNE 1, 1926.
   MR. J. A. H. Hardie, Commissioner of
Trade and Customs, and Mr. G. M. Allman,
returned to Kuching on the 19th after a visit
of inspection to the Sari has district.
   Ma. N. A. Middlemas, Superintendent of
Surveys, left Kuching on the 18th for the
Lingga District, Second Division, where
survey work is being undertaken.
   IT is notified in the Government Gazette 
that the Government Dental Surgeon is ex- 
pected at Miri from British North Borneo 
during the first week in June and at Kuching 
a fortnight later.
   MRS. H. D. Aplin, wife of the Acting
Resident, Third Division, arrived from Sibu
by the Chamois on the 17th and entered the
Grange Hospital for medical treatment to her
elbow, injured as the result of a fall.
   Two other patients are also at present in
the Grange Hospital, Father Halder from
Sibu and Mother Mary from Kanowit.
   We hope that they will all make a rapid
recovery.
   THE Rev. R. J. Small, formerly Archdea-
con of Sarawak, and lately Chaplain at
Vichy, France, has been nominated to the
vicarage of Stow Bardolph, King’s Lynn—
patron, Sir Thomas Leigh Hare.

Matron of the Grange Hospital, during the
absence on leave of Miss M. Tait.
   MRS. St. V. B. Down returned to Kuching
on the 10th from Europe after an absence of
nine months.
   THE Government Examinations (Cadet Ser-
vice) take place at Kuching on the 9th, 10th
and 11th June.
   PROCLAMATION Day, 24th May, was ob-
served in the usual manner, a public holiday
being proclaimed. The Police Force paraded
under the Acting Superintendent of Police,
Mr. C. D. Adams, and all ships in port were
dressed.
   WE are informed by the Municipal
Commissioner that the Kuching Fire Brigade
has now transferred to the new quarters in
Khoo Hun Yeang Street. Telephone No.
143.
   THE Government Printing Office, Kuching,
is now able to manufacture rubber stamps “on
the premises,’’ with a machine recently ac-
quired from Europe.
   DRY rubber harvested at Sungei Tengah
Estates during the month of April was ap-
proximately 80,000 tbs.
   WE read that the P. & O. Malwa has equalled the post war P. & O. record run by the Kaiser-i-Hind two or three years ago.
   She brought the mail, which closed in London on April 15th, to Singapore in just under three weeks.
   ACCORDING to Sandakan Notes in the B.N.B. Herald of 17th May, our English friends there knocked us into a cocked hat on St. George’s Day. Celebrations started at 9.15, and after supper, dancing was carried on until 3 p.m., and we congratulate them on this great test of physical endurance.
   No wonder the apparently indefatigable orchestra began to wilt !
   CAVALRY scouts are reported to have been seen in the bar of the Sarawak Club! No liquid fodder is missing, however.
THE SHAVING GRACE.
   THE Scot went into the barber’s. He discovered that haircutting was eightpence and a shave threepence. “I’ll just hae ma hid shaved,’’ he said.
   “CHARLIE,” said the teacher sternly, “do you know that you have broken a Commandment by stealing Arthur’s apple?” “Well,” explained Charlie, “I might just as well break one and have the apple as break another and only covet it.”
POTTED AMERICAN HISTORY.
   AMERICA invented the Fourteen Points and
did not sign the Treaty of Versailles.
   American invented the League of Nations
and kept out of it.
   American invented the cocktail and intro-
duced prohibition.
Departure of His Highness the
Rajah,
   His Highness the Rajah and the Dayang
Leonora left by the ss. Kuching at 8 a.m. on the
4th to connect with the P & O. s.s. Macedonia at
Singapore.
   A large number of people, including all Euro-
peans, Datus and Chinese Towkays, were present
on board to wish the travellers hon voyage.
   By the same steamer the Chief Secretary, Mr.
J C Moulton, O.B.E . left on seven months’ furlough.
There were also on board Captain and Mrs. Le
Gros Clark. Mrs. K H. Gillan, Miss Tait, and
Dr. J. L. Farquharson who has obtained special
leave to Europe for medical treatment. We
understand that Dr. Farquharson will probably
have to undergo an operation for appendicitis, and
we wish him a speedy recovery.
Firestone and Sarawak.
   We note that a certain Singapore newspaper
heads an interesting paragraph with “ Rumour
denied by Kuching Government.”
      Any correspondence which may have passed
I must have been of a private nature as we are
assured that the Government of Sarawak were not
approached by the Press for official information.
      We understand, however, that Mr. Harvey Fire-
stone. Junior, visited Kuching and discussed with
His Highness the Rajah the possibilities of the
Firestone Tyre & Rubber Company planting
rubber on a large scale in this country. Nothing
definite, however, has yet transpired.


THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, JUNE 1, 1926.

   Trawler Fishing off Malaya.
   
        EXPERIMENTAL VESSEL DUE SOON.
  The fisheries vessel, which has been specially built 
for the Straits Settlements Government at Middles-
brough, England, and which will test the possibi- 
lilies of modern methods of power fishing in local
waters, is due to arrive at Singapore within the next
few days, says the Straits Times.
  The new vessel is a coal-burning trawler of the 
Castle type, familiar to all who have visited East 
Coast fishing ports in England, and it will be in 
charge of three Lowestoft fishermen and a crew of 
Hylams of the type found on the tongkangs engaged 
in the timber carrying trade between Singapore and
the neighbouring islands. The trawler, which has
been named the "Tongkol” (tunnyfish) will be able
to do 3000 miles without putting into port.
  The arrangements for marketing the catches are 
already complete. First of all it will be washed and
part of it will be gutted. It will then be packed on 
ice in the usual trawler fashion in the hold, which
will be kept at the proper temperature by a refri-
gerating plant. It is thus hoped to reproduce, as
far as possible, the conditions at Home, where fish
is kept for weeks without deterioration.
  On its return to Singapore the “Tongkol” will tie
up in the Empire Dock, and the catch will be packed
in boxes with ice and conveyed by lorry to a special
cold storage room provided by the Singapore Cold
Storage Company. From this store a quantity of
fish, probably about a ton, will be removed every
morning and sold by auction in the Clyde Terrace
or Ellenborough markets. The greatest care will be
taken to release the fish judiciously, so as to avoid
interference with market conditions.
  It may be added that the auctions at which local
retailers obtain their fish supplies are conducted by
the Municipality under a system which works very
successfully, and the Government contribution to
local fish supplies, small though it will be, will thus
have to take its chance with the rest.
MODERN EQUIPMENT.
  Although it is hoped to make the trawler pay its
way as far as possible, that factor will not be allowed
to interfere with its experimental work, and the
vessel will not confine itself to any rich fishing
grounds which may be discovered but will explore
new areas. All the information obtained will be at
the disposal of the public, and if the results are
satisfactory it is hoped that local capital will be
attracted, and a fishing industry run on modern
lines begun here.
  The most important methods of power fishing are
the trawl, the Danish seine, the American purse net,
and the drift-net, and the experimental vessel is re-
quired for all these types except the last, for which
it is not altogether suitable.
       A Novel Golf Problem.
  A writer in a Home paper says :—
  Here is a problem on which the St. Andrew’s authorities would pronounce no judgment. A player hit his ball into a grass pot bunker, the bottom of which was very soft owing to recent rain. He took his niblick and played his shot, with the result that fie removed a large lump of soft turf. This remained on his club and the ball remained embedded in the lump of turf. So the player was left, after completing his stroke, with a large divot, containing his ball, firmly adhering to the face of his club.
    What was he to do? The R. and A. Rules Committee could not say.
     [Doomp th’ lot in t’hole?—ED.]	
Six hit with one bullet.
  Six men were wounded by a single bullet on the target range of the “Sixth-fifty” Infantry at San Juan (Porto Rico), says Reuter, when a rifle which was being cleaned by a soldier was accidentally discharged.
  The bullet wounded one private, struck another on the right knee, was deflected from a rifle and hit a third in the neck, then struck a captain and lieutenant in turn, and finally lodged in the hip of a fourth private.

  [We are surprised it didn’t find its way back into the rifle!—ED.]
The Failure of Prohibition.
WASHINGTON, APRIL 8.
   The Senate prohibition hearing was continued to-
day, when Mr. George Brennan, the Democratic
political leader of Chicago, declared that the prohi-
bition law was a national scandal and increased
drunkenness, immorality, corruption, murder, in-
sanity, blindness, and crime in general. “The
sensible and honest thing to do,” he added, “is to
modify or repeal this unenforceable statute.”
   “Crime wave after crime wave,” he said, “in one
city after another has occurred.” Thousands have
been killed, blinded, or crazed by the various concoc-
tions sold under counterfeit labels as genuine liquor.
All human experience proves the futility of attempt-
ing to regulate morals by statutes.”	
   Mr. Anton Cermak, President of the Cook Country
Board of Commissions, giving evidence regarding
conditions in Chicago, said there were 2,266 alco-
holic patients in the county hospital compared with
 560 in 1918, and in the psychopathic ward the in-
sane alcoholic cases had increased from 421 in 1917
to 1,136 last year.
Arrests made since 1918, the year when prohibi-
tion started, showed, according to Mr. Cermak’s
statement, that the number of drunken motor-car
drivers apprehended had increased by more than 704
per cent, disorderly conduct eases 1,006 per cent, and
 deaths due to alcohol by 449 per cent.
[Pinang Gazette & S. C.]
Hookworm.
  The first quarter’s returns of the rural sanitation campaign in Malacca have been issued and amongst other information given it is shown that first treatment for hookworm was given in 805 cases, 3,699 examinations were made of which 2,875 were positive for hookworm, the Malay percentage of infection was 82.4, the Tamil 78.5, and the Chinese 69.6. The percentage found harbouring no intestinal worms was only 12. There were 59 lectures delivered attended by 3,417 persons, the Malays and Tamils being by far the largest in numbers.

       CORRESPONDENCE.
  [The Editor is not responsible for the opinions of
Correspondents.]
To
   The Editor,
     Sarawak Gazette,
        Kuching,
SIR,	.
    May I request you to make a Correction in the
announcement about the disposal of the money
collected from the Indian Community for the Races,
etc.	
  From my letter of the 27th ultimo it might be
seen that the amount was utilised fora whole year—
one Regatta and two Races. As your announcement
mentions only one Regatta and one Race Meeting,
the reader would presume that there is a surplus of
$75.25, for the amount offered by the Indian Com-
munity on each occasion was only $75.
  Apologising tor the trouble and trusting to be
favoured. 
I beg to remain,
Sir,
Yours faithfully,

Gymkhana Club. Miri.
The Honorary Secretary Gymkhana Club, Miri, has kindly sent us the following: -
Rugby Football.
On 8th May, 1926, the first Rugby Football Match played in Sarawak took place at Miri between a team representing the Gymkhana Club, Miri, and a team from the 2nd Battalion of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment now stationed io Singapore.
    The Regiment kicked off at 5.15 p.m. and immediately took the offensive. Following a mark, a good kick found touch in the Miri 25 and for ten minutes the visitors attacked vigorously. Twice they were brought down on our line, good

tackles being made by Parry and Sargent. The Miri forwards then got in some sound footwork and a good gather and run by Blatcher carried the game into the Regiment's half Following a line out our backs got to the Regiment's 25. Vigorous work by our pack took them over the line but the ball was touched down Good kicking by the Miri scrum resulted in three determined rushes by our backs which were fully foiled by the Regiment's hard tackling and the apparent reluctance on the part of our backs to part with the ball until too late. For the second time the ball went over our opponents' line, but was again touched down. Half time found Miri still attacking strongly and no score on either side. At the commencement of the second half, Miri decided to adopt the Regiment's tactics and, immediately rushed the game into their opponents' territory. As a result of good forward work our backs made two good rushes which were well stopped, Marriott being brought down on the line by the corner flag. Following some good footwork by Tilling, Rust made a fine run to the Regiment's line where he was well tackled by the back who cleared. Breaking away from a scrum in their 25, the Regiment made a magnificent rush to the Miri 25 and for some minutes things looked extremely dangerous for>the home team. Rust finally relieved the situation by a good kick into touch. The Regiment again attacked but were checked by Blatcher who intercepted a pass and again cleared to touch Miri then forced the game back into the Regiment's 25 yards and their back cleared well. Frankis gathered the ball and made a beautiful run to the Miri 5 yards where he was stopped by Howie. The Regiment heeled well from the scrum and some clever work by their three-quarters put Lloyed over the line near the flag, the ball being finally touched down between the posts. The conversion failed.
  On renewing, the Regiment again attacked on our line, their pack getting the ball out well. Good tackling by our backs saved further score and the game closed with the score 3 - 0 in favour of the Duke's.
  On the 10th a return match was played. The Regiment proved too strong on this occasion and asserted their superiority throughout the game. Scores--half time 9—0. Full time 23—3.

Spring Meeting, 1926.
  The meeting was held on the 1st and 3rd May, under ideal weather conditions, and a large and cheery assembly of outstation visitors, having travelled many weary (or otherwise) miles, added to the gaiety of the occasion. Not a few could be seen “listening in’’ for any broadcasting direct from the
“horse’s mouth." As was to be expected, results caused frequent surprises and not all backers were financially satisfied in spite of the fact that the meeting was one of the best which has yet been held, from a racing point of view.
    Outstanding features were the brilliant performances of Apa Kena and Untong, the former, a Class IV pony, finishing second in the Winners’ Handicap, and the latter, a Class II pony, winning the coveted race, which hitherto has never been won by any pony below Class I.
   The number of amateur camera experts was unusually large, lining the rail regularly "to shoot" the finish of each race,. and some really good results were obtained.
   The enlarged "tote" with a cement approach was a vast improvement; and the arrangements for tea and refreshments were very ably organized, ice-cream being in great demand as usual.
   The Club is to be congratulated on a splendid and rapid progress.

Mary’s School
  A new departure in the education and upbringing of girls was launched on Thursday the 20th of May at S. Mary’s School when the first attempt at a “Sports Day” was held. It certainly speaks well for the advancement in thought when one remembers that a few years ago, parents’ hands would have been held up in horror at the mere suggestion of their daughters taking part in any kind of sports. It is worth mentioning that the organisation was almost entirely arranged by the pupils and teachers themselves and the success of the afternoon was due to the untiring energy and enthusiasm of the Misses Margaret Brodie and Bridget Bay and their fellow teachers. A representative gathering of spectators assembled to see the sports which were also honoured by the presence of His Highness the Tuan Muda. Mrs. C. P. Lowe very kindly consented to give away the prizes to the winners of the various events. The Net ‘Ball match was well fought out between the pupil teachers and the senior girls, the former, however, proving too strong for their opponents.

rubber to the consequent detriment of rice crops.
    Miscellaneous.—Registration of guns seems to be | complete for 1925, and 1926 permits are now being : taken out.

April, 1926.

   Mr. H. E. Cutfield, Acting Assistant District Officer, reports as follows: —
   Court.—Not many cases came before the Court during the mouth which call for special mention.
   A Dyak, Luyee, of Boban, was sentenced to three years’ K.I. for incest with his daughter-in-law Lumpoh, who was fined three piculs and $60 plasi menoa and her mother, who was implicated in the matter, was fined one picul.
   Three Malays, one man and two boys, were sentenced to nine months and four months respectively, for theft of rubber. Sali was sentenced to nine months for (1) criminal breach of trust (2) misappropriation of property.
   A case which was reported by one Jeti to His Highness the Rajah during his visit to Saratok was settled. Jeti accused Kenawang of spreading serious rumours that the Dyaks of the Sarekei were coming on the warpath against the Ulu Krian Dyaks and house in particular. Farms were neglected and everyone collected in their houses, thus much damage was done to their farms by pigs and deer. Kenawang's defence was that he was informed of the ngayau by a Chinaman in the Sarekei. He did not stop to make any inquiries, but came straight to the Ulu Krian and spread the news broadcast. Apparently a number of houses dipped the white flag as a token of their willingness to join the side of the munsoh. These houses are to be hued on my next visit to Saratok. Kenawang was duly fined two piculs and two piculs compensation to the menoa.
   A long case of land disput came up in which about fifteen Dyak houses are concerned against all the principal Malays of Saratok headed by Haji Bujang and Haji Mustapa. This case is adjourned with a pledge of $300 a side. Two Chinese were fined $25 each with $50 pledges for assault. Six Dyaks were fined $10 each for assault of a Chinaman at Roban, they were all under the influence of drink.
   Abang Bujang, Native Officer, was away the whole of the month in Kuching under medical treatment, with the result that all the Native Court cases had to be held in the Magistrate’s Court. Numbers of fines were imposed for divorces, etc.
   P.W.D.—All the whitewashing of the Government building was completed by the Police and prisoners during the month. The road from the Fort to the sands beyond the tanjong was also completed by the prisoners, who numbered 6 01
  Work was commenced on some temporary stables.
   General—Friday the 2nd being Good Friday, and Easter Monday the 5th, were observed as holidays and the Offices were closed.
   Thursday 15th being Hari Raya a public holiday was observed and the usual celebrations gone through.
   I visited Saratok on the 7th to 10th and Roban on the 20th to 22nd. Numbers of things were gone into at Saratok and several cases came up for hearing. A trial was made with a small “Pyrene” fire extinguisher, left behind by His Highness the Rajah for demonstration. Unfortunately the Dyaks built up far too large and too flamable a bonfire with the result that as soon as the match was applied it blazed up many feet high with the result that the small extinguisher could make no effect- on such a blaze.
   The lamps for the street lighting were also tested. Arrangements were made for the completion of the ditching and road at the back of the bazaar.
   I was informed that there were 32 applications for sites on which to build shops from Kuching alone, also six applications from a Kongsi Saratok and Roban Chinese, one from Selalang, several Dyaks and two Malays. If this is true it will double the size of the bazaar there. Work on the gaol and police barracks is progressing.
   On my return from Roban on the 22nd I found the Lang Endang in having five men from the P.W.D., Kuching, also pipes, windmill, etc., for the waterworks at Kabong. Work was commenced the following morning.
  The Lang Endang proceeded to Saratok and returned
to Kuching via Saribas on the 24th. Tang Eng Chong,
Court Writer, left by her to spend his leave in Kuching’
the Court Writer from Saratok taking his place.
  On the 26th, I left by boat for Lingga to meet the
Resident and proceed to Kuching for Race Week, and
was still away at the end of the month.
  Shipping.—The statistics for this port were as
follows:—
  Entered three motor schooners and ten schooners;
cleared two motor schooners and eight schooners.

Sibu.
March, 1926
  The Divisional Land Officer, Mr. C. 8. Griffiths, having been appointed Acting Superintendent of Stores in Kuching, left by the s.l. Chamois on the 5th, when I took the opportunity of proceeding to Kuching where I was unavoidably detained until the 14th. The Land Office has always been understaffed and the removal of Mr. C. S. Griffiths is to be regretted.
  On my return from Kuching I found that the first of the two seaplanes to lie used for the survey of the delta had arrived from Miri with Messrs. F. P. Raynham and Mr. R. W. L Andrews of the Aerial Survey Company. The second plane arrived with Captain S. W. Gaskell on the 19th when Mr. Raynham flew to Mukah and returned with Mrs. Raynham and Mrs. Gaskell after an absence of about two and a half hours.
  The lack of accommodation is increasingly evident and has been felt chiefly by the members of the Aerial Survey Company. There is no room on the island for more bungalows after the completion of those now under construction and it is difficult to find suitable sites on the mainland. It has been suggested that the land between the stables and the old hospital site would be the best for a residential reserve but it is, like all the land here, low lying, and has all been granted and planted up with rubber.
  An alternative site is at the end of the Race Course Road on the banks of the Igan river.
  On the 21st I left for Daro and Matu accompanied by Mr. C. E. Pascoe of the Survey Department who took the opportunity of marking a base line for the Aerial Survey near the mouth of the Bruit river. I found the District Officer and Divisional Treasurer at Matu and returned with them to Rejang on the 2Gth, stopping at Mr. H. Gild’s settlement on the way to hear a complaint made by his manager, Mr. C. F. De Haan, against the Malay mandor Drahman.


THE SARA WAK GAZETTE, JUNE 1, 1926.

   The outlook here does not appear to be hopeful, labour is unobtainable and only thirteen men are now employed tapping jelutong.
The District Officer reports us follows:-
   District Court.—The following persons were sentenced to imprisonment dm iug the month
   Ujan (Dyak) one and half years for assault with a weapon under section 324; Wong King Ting six months, Wong Ah Bee three months and six strokes, Kudang six months, Ah Ann, boy to Mr. Binnie, three months, and Ho Chung Pang one month, all for theft; Tiong Hiong Ing and Sia Ong one month each for vagrancy and Soong Ngee one month for picking pockets.
   One prisoner received three months and a whipping for attempting to escape, and three other prisoners a whipping each for petty theft.
   Sia Kung Sai (f.) was fined $50 and Tong Khek Siang, Lai Chin Yung, Tang Soon Nee (f.), and Tong Gu Nan (f.) $10 each for assault under section 323; Moi Fook $25 for being in possession of a firearm without a licence; Ling Kong Thai and Omar, respectively owner ai d juragan of m.l. Ling Kong Thai, $20 each for carrying over the licensed number of passengers under Order No. VII, 1924; Tee Koh Kee $10 under section 353 for assault, and Nyambong $1 for assault.
   There were two appeals against Native Court decisions.
   In the case of Ah Hong vs. Abang Sait, from Binatang Native Court, the appeal was upheld and fines remitted, but Thai Mob, Thai Hok, Soon Teck Hin, and Kian Kong, all traders of Binatang, were fined $20 each for giving false evidence.
   In a Kanowit case, Inche Smail vs. Forest Department, the appeal was upheld and fine remitted.
   There were a number of civil cases before the Court, especially those concerning land, but none call for special mention.
   Magistrate's and Police Courts. — Nothing worthy of special mention.
   Fines and fees amounted to $2,253. 105 deeds were registered in the Sibu Court
   General.— I was still in Sarikei at the beginning of the month, where 1 settled various matters. Dyaks complained that Foochow Chinese had not kept to the boundary made some years ago and in the vicinity of Bukit Peninju had cleared Dyak land Lance- Corporal Assim and Wong Chiu Poh. the Foochow headman, were sent to investigate the matter. The Bugis have made large farms opposite Sarikei village but there is still some opposition from the scattered Malays to allowing them to drain out to the river.
   Whilst in Sarikei I took soundings in the Nyelang River with a view to building a Government wharf near the mouth and find that a 50' wharf jutting out will give 8' at low water.
   The telephone line which had parted where it crosses the Nyelang was re-erected.
   I left for Binatang on the 2nd and heard a number of cases there, returning to Sibu on the 4th. Two Chinese were arrested for alleged false charges against a Malay.
   There seems to be some feud on between Malays and Chinese in Binatang and a number of persons were fined.
   The Resident left for Kuching on the 5th returning on the 14th. Mr. R. E. Le Sueur, Acting Assistant District Officer, Kapil, arrived on the 9th for medical treatment. Messrs. Binnie and Middlemas arrived on the 10th and stayed until 16th.
   Mr. E. V. Andreini, Assistant District Officer, Sibu, visited Sarikei and Binatang during the month.
   Two seaplanes and staffs belonging to Aerial Survey Company strived during the month.
   Mr. Binnie and Mr. Proudfoot arrived on 27th on Government business and were still here at the end of the month.
  Mr. E. V. Andreini proceeded to the Binatang district on the 25th to investigate more trouble there between Dyaks and Foochows.
  Mr. Kong Ah Fong, the Kheh and Cantonese representative on the Sibu Municipal Board, died on the 24th. He was a meat useful member and his loss is much to be regretted.
  Three inquests were held during the month.
  Police.—The strength at the end of March was one sub-inspector, two sergeants, three corporals, eight lance-corporals, sixty-seven constables, and one detective. Two Dyak recruits joined during the month and none left. Four men were returned to Kuching after completing a year at Sibu, and three men who had been training in Kuching returned here.
  An examination was held in reading and writing jawi and romanised.
  Abang Adu Seman, Native Officer, and Abang Latip, Native Officer, have been attached to the Police in turn for duty.
  The squads at Binatang and Sarikei were increased to one N.C.O. and five men each.
  Prisons.—Average number of prisoners was 51. Twelve persons were imprisoned consisting of six Foochows, two Dyaks, one Hokkien, one Melanau, one Henghua, and one Tamil. Six men were released.
  The discipline was bad, eight men being whipped for breach of prison regulations.
  Prisoners were employed on the usual work round the station.
  P.W.D. —Mr. Binnie was in Sibu twice during the month and the bazaar drains were started again.
  Sites were chosen for two bachelor bungalows in Sibu, two clerks’ quarters in Binatang, two clerks’ quarters in Sarikei, and one Forest Ranger’s house in Sibu.
  Work has begun on all except the last named. Work has also started on two new wards for the Sibu hospital.
   The Aerial Survey Company moved in the temporary quarters built for them by Public Works Department.
  The usual routine work was carried out during the month
  The waterworks is running as well as possible hut the service is inadequate. A shipload of coal was sent np for the waterworks. A contract was signed to erect Survey Department quarters in Sibu.
LAND AND SURVEY DEPARTMENT.
   The Acting Divisional Land Officer reports as 
follows :—
   The Engkilo rentis is now finished and pegs are being put in at 5-chain intervals in the main east and west rentis, road reserves being left at half- mile intervals, and at 20-chain intervals in the north and south ones. This work should be finished in a day or so when the lots will be available for planters
   Mr. C. S. Griffiths went to Kuching on the 5th and Mr. C. E. Pascoe took over supervision of the office.
   I was absent with a slight attack of influenza from the 8th to the 13th.
   I took over from Mr. C. E. Pascoe on the 17th.
   Quit rent payments have been coining in well all the month and the rush can he said to be over now.
Rejang.
March, 1926.
   The District Officer reports as follows:—
   General.— During the month the Divisional Treasurer, Mr. Jacques, visited Rejang, Daro and Matu and went through the accounts of these places. His instructions to the Court Writers have been of great value in explaining various points in the new methods of keeping books.


148
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, JUNE 1, 1926.
  The Resident of the Division also paid a visit to
the district and inspected the site of the new station 
at Matu. I am of opinion that it will not be passible 
to carry through the whole of the programme pro-
posed during this year owing to the shortage and
high price of labour. Contracts made in 1924 and
since held over cannot be enforced.
  An appeal case arising from damage done to Ah
Eong’a rubber plantation was held over for the hear-
ing of a further case relating to same garden.
  At Matu a man convicted of theft of jelutong was
sentenced to six months’ imprison menu A num her 
of cases relating to land were brought up for hearing.
At Daro jungle was examined above San gel Paning
and leave was given to clear this for gardens.

“T” marks for the use of the aerial survey.
  The dresser, Michael Tai, was recalled to Sibu 
during the mouth and has not been replaced.

   The Divisional Medical Officer reports as follows:
   The number of in-patients treated at hospital during the month amounted to 105.
   There were 779 out-patient at tendances, being an average of 25 1 daily. 91 arsenical injections were given.
   I regret to state that ten deaths occurred in hospital this month. Four being due to pneumonia, two to advanced phthisis, two to advanced dysentery and two to mitral disease.
   In every cage the patient on admission was either a. moribund condition, or in an advanced stage of  the disease, also the amount of patients treated is much greater in number than formerly.
  Four operations were performed under general
anaesthetic:—
        2 Extensive wounds sutured.
        1 Removal of supernumerary digit
        1 Incision of bubo.

the population had been vaccinated The total
vaccinations performed in the Coast Division this
year being 16,715.
  534 passengers off ships were examined, 167 being
immigrants.
  There has been an increase in respiratory affec-
tions this month, some cases of pneumonia being
especially severe.
  Dysentery is also on the increase to a small extent,
due I have no doubt to the weather and the present
appalling condition of the bazaar.

H. B. CROC KER, Resident Third-Division.        COASTDIVISION.Mukah and Balingian.
March,
  General.—The event of the month was the visit of-His Highness the Rajah and the Dayang Leonora in H.H.M.Y. Maimuna mi the 18th. Their Highnesses approach was heralded by a Hen plane; piloted by Captain Gaskell of the Aerial Harvey Company, which arrived from Bintulu about midday and landed on the river, canning much excitement amongst the native comm unity, the majority of whom had never seen what they termed a kapal belun.
  The motor yacht Maimuna being unable to cross the bar, His Highness, accompanied by the Dayang Leonora, Mrs. Rayham and Mrs. Gaskell, landed in the m.l. Leonora at 5 p.m., and were greeted by the Catholic Father, Native Officers, the. leading Chinese merchants, Native Chiefs of the district and a large gathering of natives. His Highness afterwards walked through the bazaar amidst showers of crackers,, and inspected the kampongs as far as the Telian main bridge.

  The following day His Highness sat in Court and
was pleased to inform the merchants that electric
light for Mukah was contemplated provided they
would share in the cost of installation.
  In dealing with many requests from the leading
natives for further water facilities. His Highness
promised to consider the matter as soon as an equit-
able method of levying a water rate had been evolved.
  Many of the village Chiefs petitioned His High-
ness for salaries and the Mosque officials asked for
increases in their emoluments. Certain types of
natives endeavoured to open up cases settled nearly
twenty years ago and others applied for release
from payment of exemption tax.
  An imbecile, named Piut, was ordered to remain
in his kampong under charge of relatives, and
largesse was granted to some local blind men; no
further business transpiring. His Highness pro-
ceeded to the local branch of the Roman Catholic
Mission were he was shown around the new school
buildings by the Rev. Father Quadekker The same
afternoon another seaplane arrived from Sibu piloted
by Captain Rayham, who was accompanied by aerial
photographer Mr. Andrews; after calling on His
Highness the Rajah, Captain Rayham embarked
Mrs Rayham and Mrs Gaskell in his machine and
left for Sibu, followed a few minutes later by Cap-
tain Gaskell and Mr. Andrews in the other seaplane.
  His Highness the Rajah, accompanied by the
Dayang Leonora and myself, sailed for Kuching in
H.H.M Y Maimuna on the 21st.
  Datu Awang Udin reported his return from a
visit to the interior Dyaks on the 2nd, and stated
that all the smallpox cases were confined to Sungei
Selangau, a branch stream on the true right bank of
the Mukah River about four days' journey from
Mukah.
  Cadet Officer Mr. Arundell, accompanied by
Native Officer Abang Haji Mohidin and vaccinator
Cheng Geek Cheng, left for Balingian by the over-
land route via Siteng and Bawan in order to super-
vise vaccination and ileal with any outstanding Court
work; they returned by sea on the 12th, and reported
having vaccinated large numbers of Dyaks, chiefly
in the Sungei Arip, and settled most of the Court
cases.
  On the morning of the 12th, the first flying
machine ever seen locally passed over Mukah at a
height of about 1,500 feet ; this proved to be one of
the Aerial Survey Company’s machines proceeding
from Miri to Sibu to engage in the aerial survey of
the Rejang Delta.
  On the 13th a number of schooners succeeded in
entering the Mukah river with cargoes of foodstuffs
the shortage both here and at Belingian had become
acute and as usual attempts were made to raise
prices abnormally. Unfortunately these schooners
had left Kuching over a month previously so most
of the perishable goods had to be destroyed, and it
was not until the end of the month that the situation
had became normal.
  The District Officer of Oya and Dalat came over
on horseback on the 18th to meet His Highness the
Rajah, and kindly took charge of affairs during my
absence in Kuching.
  I returned from short leave in Kuching on the
3lst, and resumed duties from that date.
  Court— Owing to the Mohammedan fasting month,
Ramathan. few cases were brought before the
Courts. Idir bin Iloh of Balingian was sentenced
to six months' imprisonment for having wounded
his wife and her paramour. Jimbun, on discovering
them in “flagrante delicto," the guilty parties who
have since recovered were fined and the Tua Kam-
pong was reprimanded for attempting to hush up
this case.
  Banying, the Tua Kampong of Tegah, was fined
$100 for evading vaccination himself after being
repeatedly ordered to see that all his followers were
vaccinated.
   A property dispute and several sago boundary
disputes were settled, and endeavours were made to
discourage the rapid transfer of ancestral sago plan-
tations to the rich Melanau moneylender class, but
it is feared the majority of the people are determined
to dispose of any sort of. title they may have for
ready cash, and no effort is made to clear or improve
the plantation by either the small holder or the
moneylender, yet some of the latter are already in
possession of as many as a dozen plantations in
various parts of the district.
   Tikam bin Jelib was fined for refusing to accom-
pany Datu Awang Udin to the interior on bis recent
visit to the Dyak smallpox patients.
   Health.— Datu Awang Udin returned from the
interior on the 2nd and repotted having discovered
twenty-nine cases of smallpox with six deaths
amongst the Dyaks of Sungei Selangau, a branch on
the true right bank of the Mukah River. Most of
the people had taken refuge in the jungle, but the
vaccinator who accompanied the Datu reports
that he has isolated these twenty-nine cases locally
and succeeded in vaccinating 902 persons.
   The new Dresser, Ahmat Chee, was laid up with
fever since his return from smallpox duty at Dalat,
and as there were many applicants for vaccination
the work had to be done by clerk W. Chua Tambi.
and the Reverend Father Quadekker very kindly
assisted by vaccinating many of the bazaar Chinese
and Telian Melanaus.
   It was found necessary to fine the Chief of Kam-
pong Tega, whose kampong had been twice visited
by the Datu and a vaccinator, and all persons
reported vaccinated, the Chief was, however, found
to have succeeded in evading this vaccination.
   The Divisional Medical Officer, Doctor L. B.
Haye, was asked to come over by bicycle from Oya
on the 15th to inspect the district and work of the
vaccinators; the doctor himself vaccinated 300
persons in the local villages, but owing to a septic
foot and the illness of the dresser he was obliged to
returned to Sibu on the 17th.
   Native Officer Abang Haji Mohidin supervised
the vaccination of another 200 person; in Kampong
Abdul Hamid, and Mr. Arundell supervised the vac-
cination of over 210 persons in Kampong Judan.
   Public Works.—The Tamil labour gang was em-
ployed clearing the old Kuala road and cutting
drains in swampy parts of the station grounds. 
   The prisoners, averaging 10'22 men, whitewashed
No. 1 bungalow where necessary, and worked on the
general upkeep of the grounds around the Govern-
ment station.
   The people of Kampongs Haji Hussin, Haji
Matair, and Haji Dullah turned nut en masse and
thoroughly repaired the roads through their res-
pective villages and raised all such roads above flood
level. The people of the Upper Telian and Petanak
Kampongs tinned out and cleared the new road
which carries the water main from the Petanak
Intake.
   Cattle -. - Owing to the numerous deaths amongst
the calves and the poor condition of the herd, it was
deemed advisable to discharge cowman Samat,
and engage a Tamil Indian to look after the cattle
in future ; the herd now numbers 17 head.
   Forest.—The Assistant Conservator, Third and
Coast Divisions, visited the district on the 11th and
selected a Forest Reserve at Sungei Skei, inspected
various jelutong workings, and checked the. Forest
accounts to date; lie left for Sibu on the 17th.
   Divisional Treasury.—The Divisional Treasury
Clerk, Francis N. Lim. returned from headquarters
on the 22nd after handing in the completed Coast
Divisional Accounts for the first half of the year
1925.

Oya and Dalat.
March, 1926.
  The District Officer, Mr. P. M. Adams, reports as follows:—
  Court.—No cases call for special comment under this heading.
  General.—Complaints were made against T.K. Bujang of Bakong and, though there is reason to believe that this man is unsuitable for the post of T.K., the witnesses broke down under cross examination.
  Communication with Kuching direct reopened and several schooners entered and cleared. The bazaars were almost empty of necessaries so that the arrival of the schooners was particularly welcome. The opportunity too was taken to ship jelutong whilst the price was still high.
  On the 18th I rode over to Mukah to meet H. H. the Rajah.
  I returned on the 20th accompanied by Mr. Arundell who returned to Mukah on the 22nd.
  The Acting Divisional Officer accompanied His Highness to Kuching. Oya people were very impressed by the novel sight of two seaplanes flying over the station on their way from Miri to Sibu.
  Marine —The m.l. Leonora was painted and returned to Mukah on the 15th. The use of her has been greatly appreciated.
  P. W. D.— Progress on the new Court House has been such that the building will probably be completed by the end of April. II. was feared at one time that we were short of belian timber but this difficulty has been overcome.
  Thanks to co-operation of the Shipping Master and the District Officer, Bintulu, 20,000 belian attaps were unloaded from the s.s. Sulong off Kuala Oya.
  Minors repairs were effected to the Native Officer’s house at Dalat.
  Health—Most of the time has been taken np with preventing the spreading of the smallpox epidemic at Dalat.
  The D.M.O. Sibu arrived at Dalat on the 9th. He inspected and approved of the steps taken to isolate the patients
  One more case was reported on the day of the D.M.O.'s arrival and had obviously been hidden until then.
  The Court Writers have vaccinated 1,149 people since the epidemic started. It is thought that with the exception of some Dyaks in the interior very few people have succeded in evading vaccination
  The isolation camp was abandoned and the huts destroyed on the 24th. It seems safe to report that Dalat is now free from smallpox. The vaccinator, accompanied by police, was sent to the interior to investigate the extent of the epidemic amongst the Dyaks and reports all clear.
The D.M.O. vent to Mukah on the 15th.
  Forest.—The Assistant Conservator, Mr. McLeod, visited the district from the 9th to 11th.
  Prison.—Prisoners averaged 11 and were employed on general upkeep.
  Trade.—395 piculs of jelutong and 242 koyans of raw sago were exported to Kuching.
Trade returns were .—
          Exports	... $126,463.50
          Imports	...	24,267.42
  Shipping.—Four motor schooners and six schooners entered, and three motor schooners and six. schooners cleared during the month.
Bintulu.
March, 1926.
  The District Officer of Bintuiu reports a s follows:—
  General.—His Highness the Rajah was pleased to visit this Station and, with Day an g Leonora, arrived in the H.H.M Y. Maimuna on the morning of the 16th. The tide was low, but the sea was very culm and His Highness and the Dayang were able to come ashore in the motor Nellie. The Maimuna proceeding to Miri to bunker fuel oil.
  On landing His Highness was met by Datu Haji Abdullah, the Tua Kampongs, Government servants and all the principal traders.
  The following day His Highness again met these and a representative gathering of the people m the fort All were invited to speak on any matters they wished. The Tua Kampongs asked for pay. The Chinese asked that the Government keep more money on hand, so that they might draw on this, through their towkays in Kuching, for trading purposes, also that a larger supply of subsidiary coinage be kept, also for sites for new shops.
  Some Kadayans asked to plant rubber. The usual request was once more heard from a couple of Dyaks minta xurat snapang.
  His Highness walked through the bazaars and conversed with several of the shopkeepers He also visited the Chinese school winch had only lately been reopened after a closure of marly three years.
  During the afternoon a message came from Miri to look out for a seaplane due to pass about 4 o'clock bound for Sibu and to telegraph Sibu if it was sighted. Shortly after 4 o'clock the plane arrived and after having encircled the Station flew on down the coast. At about 4.30 p m. it returned and coming down on the river ran up on the beach quite close to the bungalow. Captain S. H Gaskell was taking this plane to Sibu where aerial survey work is being done for the Government, and was accompanied by Mis. Gaskell and Mis. Bayham, but encountering thick weather and having a dicky propel I or decided to come down here and finish the journey on the morrow.
  The arrival of the seaplane caused great excitement amongst the natives All that evening and the next morning until the plane left the kampongs were entirely emptied the inhabitants all being on the beach looking, for their first time, at the seaplane, or kapal bilun as they called it.
  Captain Gaskell very kindly gave the District Officer a chance to view Bintulu from the air. He then left at 10 o'clock for Mukah and took Mr. R. V. Palfreman, Assistant District Officer of Tatau, who was returning to his Station, as far as the mouth of that river.
  His Highness the Rajah, Dayang Leonora, Mrs. Ravham and Mrs Gaskell, sailed for Mukah in H.H.M.Y. Maimuna at 11 o’clock on the 18th
  The s.s. Sulong passed here northbound on 25th February; she only returned on the 6th of this month, when she stopped a few hours off the Kuala to load 20,000 attaps for Oya She had not arrived here again by the end of the month. It is fortunate the Sarawak Steamship Company run their ships prettv regularly, or mails for this Station.,. any way, would be very few and far between; as it is, mails sent by s.s. Auby come via Limbang and

Miri, and if by s.s. Gladys usually via Miri. The p.s. Adeh when on the run nearly always made her two trips a month.
   Application has been made by a firm of Tatau  Chinese to erect a sawmill at the mouth of the Jelai River, just below the Government Station. The matter has been referred to the Chief Secretary.
   Courts.—There has been slightly more work in the Courts this month. One, Gemok, was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for non-payment of brian ; Kit Ann was fined $25 for breach of Order XLV?, 1924; Kedi and Dani nine months each for deliberately hiding in the kampong persons infected with smallpox; Along six months for not immediately reporting a case of smallpox in his house ; Savas one, year for hiding a smallpox corpse in his house and burying it secretly. Two Chinese were fined for assault.
   Health.—The health of the District has very greatly improved. With the exception of the above- mentioned cases of smallpox, which had been brought back to the kampongs from padi farms, no new cases have occurred for some time. Sulai, the telephone linesman, is recovering but his wife has died. There are still eleven cases in the isolation camp here but most of these will be discharged shortly. Dresser Benjamin, from Pandan, and Augustus Chai, from Sebauh, report that their isolation camps are empty and that no more new cases are occurring. The former was ordered to go upriver to Tubau and vaccinate all Kayans, Penans and others there. He has returned and reports that he was unable to vaccinate any of these people. They all refused vaccination when Dresser Senada was sent there last August, they again refuse on the grounds of their being busy on their farms, etc., Practically all the Dyaks in this river submitted to vaccination and this without the slightest doubt saved possibly hundreds of lives. Fortunately the disease has not spread further up river than Labang. When I can get away to visit Tubau I will take a dresser and vaccinate the Kayans and Penans. Dressers up river at Sebauh and Pandan have vaccinated 1,041 persons during the month and Dresser Senada here has done 416. This brings the total number of vaccinations to 10,095.
   Public Works.—The bungalow pangkalan has been completed. Work on the Forest Bungalow has progressed very rapidly and this building will be ready for occupation by the end of April. The house for a Customs Officer is nearly finished. Work on the runway to the new wharf has been started. The planking and glegars for this new wharf have been ordered from the Dyaks and will be coming in by the time the piles are driven. The material for the Customs shed and enclosure should arrive from Kuching shortly.
   Trade- -The trade of the district seems to be steadily improving, Jelutong has reached the highest price ever known here before and has been bought for as much as $23 per picul. This high price, however, has its disadvantages, as unless the Forest Department continually inspect the jelutong roads, I am afraid a great many trees will be killed by workers with “the get rich quick idea.” They can afford to pay almost any fine for trees ruined with the price at $22 and $23 per picul. I have sent all the Forest Guards out examining roads. The working of belian timber and belian attaps is also increasing enormously. Local merchants are making contracts to supply attaps, I believe one hundred laksa, for the use of various rubber estates in B.N.B. The Brunei Government are also I believe in contract for a considerable number of attaps.
   I am doing my best to improve the standard of these belian attaps. It has improved somewhat, but not enough considering the price of this commodity.
There is still far too large a percentage of worthless wood bidden in each bundle. The remedy lies in the hands of the buyers and they have been informed now that they must examine the attaps they purchase and prosecute those who cheat them; in the same manner as, not long ago, they had to examine jelutong bought, to stop the adulteration.
  A contract has just been let to a Tatau firm of Chinese to supply the Public Works Department, Kuching, with 350 tons of various sized belian timber. A previous contract to supply Sibu with certain belian posts, etc., has been practically completed, and the wood will be ready for removal almost immediately.
  With jelutong at a high price and plenty of work for others in the belian line, there is work for al), and it is most difficult to even engage casual labour, while to find persons to become policemen, mowers, gardeners, etc., is absolutely impossible.
  Application has been made by Bintulu Chinese for a site for four new shops. This site has been chosen and difficult negotiations with two native holders who own very ramshackle buildings on it are progressing.
  The trade returns for the month are as follows :—
               1926.	1925.	1924.
Imports ... $54,589.40 $32,942.86	$28,583.89
Exports ...	82,463.67	49,813.62	34,456.24

  The rainfall was 11'08 inches.
Tatau.
March, 1926.
  The Assistant District Officer, Tatau, Mr. Palfreman, reports as follows:—
  On February the 17th I left for Penjarai, in company with Native Officer Abang Bojeng, in order to investigate certain rumours that had been received, and stayed there three nights; during my investigations various tracks were found around the Punan house, but the persons causing these tracks are still unknown, it appears, however, that a party of Dyaks are roving round with intentions none too good. On February 21st 1 left for the ulu Penjarai and slept the night at the Bukitan’s house there, the next day leaving overland for Banyieng’s house in the ulu Anap. Here a few cases were brought before me and duly settled. After a stay of two nights I left for the Pelagus by boat, arriving at Dana's house in the ulu Selai on the 27th, the Dyaks here are Batang Rejang Dyaks and are farming in Anap territory ; a full report and map concerning this matter has already been forwarded to the District Officer, Bintulu, under separate cover.
  Leaving Dana’s house on the 1st of March I arrived at Banyieng’s house on the 3rd and proceeded down the Anap and investigated certain rumours rife amongst the Dyaks, some of which there is no doubt are true ; a full report concerning the whole of these matters has already been forwarded to the District Officer, Bintulu, under separate cover
  During my visit to the Pelagus, Penghulu Tamboh and Penghulu Bunyah accompanied me, the Native Officer, Abang Bojeng, being left at the Punan house in the Kakus to keep an eye on the affairs there, he had, however, arrived at the Court House, Tatau. some time before my return.
  I arrived at Tatau on the 5th and left again for Bintulu on the 13th to discuss certain matters with the District Officer, Bintulu. These matters having been dealt with, and thanks to the kindness of Captain Gaskell, I returned to the mouth of the Tatau river by seaplane and thence to the Court

House, Tatau, by boat, arriving back on the 18th. In 
order to deal with, certain matters up river 1 am 
leaving again for the ulu Anap on the 24th and 
expect to be away some 10 or 15 days.
   Court.—There were no cases of any importance
whatsoever during the month.
   P.W.D.—The prisoners are still engaged on clear-
ing the site for the Wireless Station, and arrange-
ments are being made for the kampong people to
assist in this work, since the prisoners by themselves
are insufficient.
   The Chinese here were ordered to rebuild a
“kongsi rest house" since this house was in a very bad
state of repair, they have already’ started this work
and it should not be long before the repairs are
completed.
   Health -From various reports received there 
appears to be a considerable amount of venereal .
disease among the Dyaks below the Court House, it
is, however, impossible to do anything in the matter ,
since the actual Dyaks infected will not admit they 
are ill, otherwise the health of the district remains 
good.
   General.—During the month a woman by name 
Indai Lamban of Penghulu Bunyah’s house was 
taken by a crocodile whilst cutting vegetables on the
river side close by her house. This is the second
person taken by crocodiles in this river during the
last four months.
   Shipping.—On the 23rd the Sarawak Oilfields
Steamship Burong entered the port to load belian
and up to date of my departure for up river had not
cleared the port.
TRADE.
  Imports $5,697.60; Exports $533.57.
W. F. DE V. SKRINE,
Acting Divisional Officer.
  M.L. Irene made two trips to Niah and Sibuti
with the lighter. H.H.M.Y. Maimunah arrived
from Bintulu on the night of the 16th, sailing the
following day after bunkering.
  On the 12th instant I inspected the Rangers and
Police on parade. It is quite impossible to get any
degree of smartness without a band of some des-
cription, more especially as the parades are held on
a grass ground and the men are bare-footed. I
propose therefore to re-introduce fifes and drums.
  The news of the death of His Excellency The
Governor of British North Borneo was received
on the morning of the 5th instant. The flag at the
Government Offices staff was half-masted.
  The two seaplanes left here for Sibu to start
survey work in the Third Division.
  I left for Baram on the 19th instant, accompanied
by Dr. Farquharson, who had just returned from
the north. I was still away at the end of the
month.
  Amongst other visitors to the Station were the
Right Reverend the Bishop of Labuan and Sara-
wak, Mr. and Mrs Aplin, Mr. and Mrs. Carpenter,
Mr. Fischer of the Philippines Forestry Depart-
ment, Messrs. Waley Cohen, Holl, Gild, and General
Powell.
April, 1926.
  Courts.— Fines and fees in the Miri Courts
amounted to $518. There were no cases of any
importance.
  One appeal was entered against a decision of the
District Officer.
  Two inquests were held during the mouth. The
I body of a male child was found in a basket on
the beach at Tanjong Lobang. Medical evidence
proved that the child did not die of drowning,
 though the body had been washed up from the sea.
The cause of death was not known. No further
evidence is forthcoming as yet. The mutilated
body of a Chinese coolie was discovered in the river
FOURTH DIVISION.
Miri.
March, 1926.
  Court.—Fewer cases than usual (78 in all) came  before the Courts for hearing during the month. Two Malays were sentenced to terms of imprisonment for absconding. These men were arrested in Labuan. A Chinese coolie was imprisoned for criminal impersonation. In the Resident's Court a charge of assault preferred by a native against a European was dismissed.
  P.W.D.—The work of ballasting and asphalting the Court road was taken in hand, but work has been delayed by shortage of stone.
  Necessary repairs to the Gymkhana Club Road bridge were effected. A contract was signed for scavenging the bazaars. This work has been done by prison gangs, but this is not possible at present. A well was sunk for the use of the Wireless Station and Forestry Checking Station and a good supply of water has been obtained. Contracts were signed for clerks’ quarters, police barracks, and native officer’s house at Niah. Work was started on a new pork market at Miri, and contract signed for the erection of Sikh police barracks.
  General.—The Baram launch La Follette was up on the Company slip-way for repairs as she had developed a leak. The hull is fairly sound but the age of the launch necessitates continual attention, and there is no doubt that it is economically unsound to continue to expend money for repairs to this vessel.
at Pujut. This coolie had been missing for four
days when his body was found. The Coroner’s jury
brought in a verdict of wilful murder against some
person or persons unknown. Several arrests have
been made and inquiries are being prosecuted.
   Medical.—The Tua Kampong of Suai reported
the death of a Bintulu man at Suai. This man
arrived at Suai suffering from smallpox and was
promptly isolated. Eighteen persons have died at
Suai, but no more cases have been reported One
case occurred at Miri on the 10th instant, the man
being a member of the crew of a vessel which had
lately returned from Bintulu. He was at once
isolated on the Peninsula and died on the 19th. No
other cases have occurred.
  Haji Marais of Bintulu was reported for deliber-
ately ignoring the quarantine notice at the mouth
of the Suai. and proceeding direct to the kampong.
This man was arrested and has since been heavily
 fined.
  Neither at Niah nor at Sibuti have there been 
   any cases of smallpox.
	Forestry.—Mr. Corson, Assistant Conservator of
 Forestry Fourth and Fifth Divisions, visited Baram,
 Miri, Sibuti and Niah during the month, returning
north by s. s. Marudu on the 28th.
  Monopolies.—The non-arrival of opium shipped
by a motor schooner which sailed from Kuching for
Sibuti on the 11th resulted in a shortage of supplies
at Miri. A small stock was sent up from Niah and
 Sibuti on the 13th, but this was completely exhausted
 by the time s.l. Lucile arrived from Kuching on the
 18th with a further 10,000 packets. The La-
Follette, which had been sent from Baram to meet
the Lucile unfortunately passed her at night between
 Miri and Kidurong.


THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, JUNE 1, 1926.

  This further supply was finished on the 20th on -which date I was advised from Sibuti of the arrival of the motor schooner with the original consignment, which reached here by launch on the following day. The non-arrival of this consignment within a reasonable time caused a good deal of anxiety here
  P. W.D.—In consequence of a landslip, it was found necessary to empty the reservoir. The opportunity was taken to lift part of the mam and clean out the pipes. This work was not completed at the end of the month.
  One block of Clerks’ Quarters was completed, but the work was so badly done that the full contract price was not paid. Work on the Court Road and on the Pork Market is held up for lack of stone, there having been no Government vessel here since the 2nd.
  General. — I returned from Baram on the 5th instant and left for Niah on the 11th. On the 13th I went on to Sibuti, spending Hari Raya there and returning to Miri on the 15th
  There were a few petty cases for settlement. Whilst at Sibuti, at the request, of the Tua Kampong, an order was issued prohibiting the use of “tuba” in the Satap stream or tributaries.
  Haji Dulgapar, for many years Tua Kampong of Bungai, is now too decrepit to attend to his duties and will be relieved as soon as possible by a younger man. Haji Dulgapar moved to Bungai from Brunei territory about 40 years ago and confidently asserts that his age is now 120 !
  s.s. Sulong arrived from Kuching on the 2nd and s.s. Auby on the 21st. The s.s. Gladys called on her way to Baram on the 30th.
  Offices were closed on the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th, and again on Han Raya, the 14th.
  Mr. and Mrs. Aplin returned from north on the 16th and left for Kuching with Mr. Dick on the 26th
  s.1. Lucile was towed over the bar on the 26th and left for Kuching, having been held up in the river since the 18th.
    Lance-Corporal Lias of Baram Police was reduced
in rank for gross neglect of duty.
      Medical.—Reports of a fresh outbreak of small-
 pox in the Tinjar were received early in the month.
Ten persons are said to have died. Four in-patients
and 57 out-patients were treated at the hospital,
26 of the latter being for N.A.B. injections.
   P.W.D.—The prison gangs finished the raising
of the bazaar road and cleared ground near the
boat-shed. A start was made with Lubok Nibong
Road, which is in danger of disappearing altogether
 if not taken in hand. In order to complete the
 work outside labour will have to be procured.
      Buildings for the wireless station were completed
by the contractor early in the month, but the work
 has been so badly done and the buildings are so
unsatisfactory that payment in full has been with-
 held pending a detailed examination.
   General. — Mr. P. E. Cox of the Wireless Depart-
 ment arrived on the 8th to supervise the erection of
 the new wireless station.
   Dresser Segili relieved Dresser Reggie, who re-
 turned to headquarters. The Resident Fourth
 Division arrived from Miri on the 19th, accompanied
 by Dr. Farquharson, the latter leaving on the 22nd.

23rd.
   Other visitors to the station were Messrs. Me
 Gowen, Weigall, and Hamilton, the latter having

Baram.
March, 1926.
  The Acting District Officer of Baram reports as follows:—
  Travelling.—I went up the Akah by boat as far as Long Sinai and from there walked overland to Long Sait, thence by boat down the Selungau and up the main river to Lio Mato. One of the boats was split and swamped while passing rocks on the way up; luckily the river was low at the time or the accident might have been more serious, occurring as it did after dark
  The Kayans and Kennyahs appear to be getting a good harvest, more especially the latter.
  I returned to Baram on the 13th instant.
  Mr. Woodward left for the Ulu Tatau on the 26th accompanied by the Assistant Native Officer, Wan Mahomat. The purpose of the visit was to meet the Penans. Mr. Woodward was still away at the end of the month
  Court.— During my visit up river Tama Unyang Lah of Akah was fined for gross contempt of Government Orders. He had previously been fined for a similar offence in 1923. Tama Uhlau Paran was also fined for insulting Penghulu Tama Wan Bayar while travelling under the Government flag. Two men were sentenced to terms of imprisonment for swindling Kayans. A Chinese was fined for failing to keep his trading accounts in a proper manner.
  Three Dyaks found living in Kayan country contrary to regulations were sentenced to terms of imprisonment.
   In the absence of the Acting District Officer, Mr.
 W. F. Dick, Mr, E. M. Woodward, Cadet, reports
 HS follows :—
       Court.—Bandi fined $25, damaging rubber trees;
 Sambang imprisoned 3 months overstaying on his
pass ; Mok Sam fined $25. and Ho Sek (prisoner)
 one month's extra sentence, breach of prison re-
 gulations. Bukol fined $15, travelling without a
 pass. Fines and Fees amounted to $687.53.
      General.—On the 1st instant I was at Long
 Malinau (about 2 days by prau up the Tatau River),
 where I had arrived three or four days previously
with the Native Officer, Tuanku Mohamat, to meet
the Tatau Penans. There was heavy rain every
 day and the river was in flood, and this meant that
many of the Penans did not arrive. However, on
 the 1st instant there were 52 of them present and
to celebrate the occasion a “main" was held in the
Kubu, which was being built by Penghulu Tama
Tengan Malang's men. Oyau Amat, the Penan
Penghulu, did not bring very much this time in the
way of rubber, jungle produce, or mats with which
to barter with the Kayans, but informed me that all
his people were well and free from sickness. These
Penans are becoming more accustomed to the sight
of strangers and when they have learnt to use a
“prau" more efficiently will no doubt have the
courage, and Government will probably be able to
 persuade them, to come down to Baram to pay in
 their tax instead of paying it through the Kayans
 as they do al present. On the 3rd instant I was
 met by 8.1. La Follette at Batu Blah, and Dresser
 Sejili vaccinated 48 of Tama Paya Anyi’s people
from the Apoh.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, JUNE 1, 1926
  The outstanding item of importance has been the
ever increasing shortage of provisions and foodstuffs
in the bazaar owing to the non-arrival of a boat
from Kuching, where the Chinese have most of their
credit. On the 15th instant the shortage became
acute and there was a consequent increase in prices.
This procedure considerably embarrassed the natives
who as a result suffered undeservedly while the
Chinese benefited financially by the shortage. This
inconvenient state of affairs was apparently the
result of certain differences of opinion between
Messrs. Sarawak Steamship Co., Ltd., and the
Chinese traders here.
  Hari Raya was ushered in by the usual firing of
crackers, and by illuminations at night. At 8 a.m.
on the 14th instant a salute of seven guns was fired
and the Malay community visited Mr. W. F. Dick’s
bungalow. Later in the day Mr. W. F. Dick, Mr.
T. A. Corson, and myself, visited the houses of the
two Native Officers, Tuanku Drahman and Tuanku
Mohamat and also Wan Taha. In the evening
there was a “main” in the Fort in which Dyaks,
Kayans, and Malays took part.
  On the 20th instant 12 Kampar Dyaks informed
the Acting District Officer that they where re-
turning to Simanggang and taking 12 piculs of
rubber with them to sell in Kuching because the
local price of rubber was too low. It seems a pity
that this procedure is not followed more often when
the local price is too low.
  On 22nd instant Galau, upriver agent, went
up river to inspect further birds' nests caves at Long
Palai, and to make preparations for the Acting Dis-
trict Officer's proposed trip to the Kalabit country.
  On the 24th instant Thiam Jiew was transferred to
Niah for 2 months and as no one has taken his
place, most of the extra work devolves on the Head
Clerk. Ah Bee.
  The Resident was here on the 1st instant and left
for Miri on the 5th. Mr. Corson arrived here on
the 9th instant and left on the 17th. Mr. and Mrs.
Aplin arrived here on the night of the 19th instant and left for Miri and Kuching on the 24th.
  Medical.—One patient admitted and sixty out-  patients treated during the month. Of these latter ten were Malays, thirty-nine Dyaks, nine Chinese, one European, and one Indian Twenty-four N.A.B. injections were given dm mg the month. One Dyak suffering from a cut wound was transferred to Miri hospital on the 24th instant.
  Forestry.—356 logs were brought down from up  river. On 19th instant the Apoh Kayans brought I down four belian posts and twenty belian planks I which have been used for renewing the Government wharf.
  Agriculture.—Reports concerning padi indicate that a moderate harvest only is being reaped.
Rainfall was 3 26 inches.
  P.W.D.—The prisoners have been working on the Lobok Nibong Road which badly needs re-making. Work was delayed for a few days during earlier part of the month owing to floods, but on the whole good progress has been made and over 100 fathoms of the road have been completed. The Foochow community offered to undertake the task of remaking this road but the terms of their contract were such that the Acting District Officer was unable to accept the offer.
  Police.—Owing chiefly to the high price of rubber there is great difficulty in obtaining recruits for the police force. During the month P.C Mamba resigned at his own request, and P.C. Sa'at was invalided from the force. Basri and Kanchil bin Dillah were recruited, but even so tbe strength of the force is still insufficient for the amount of work to be done. Corporal Rebi bin Drahman and P.C. Lias were transferred to Miri and L.-C. Tewit and
P.C. Saba have taken their places here. The Police
Force now numbers thirteen, excluding four sta-
tioned at Bakong, two stationed at Long Akar, and
two at Lio Mato.
   Telegraphs and Telephones.— Owing to the fre-
quent occasions on which the telephone line breaks
down between here, and Miri the new wireless in-
stallation bus been found to be more practicable and
useful than the telephone. During the month 166
telegrams were received and 123 transmitted.
   Trade and Shipping.—During the month s.l. La
Follette made two trips to Miri, four as far as
Kuala Baram, and one up river to Batu Blah.
 s.l Baby made six trips to the Station, and on the
22nd instant s.l. Anggas arrived and the next day
 proceeded to Batu Blah to fetch the logging outfit
of Messrs. Sarawak Oilfields, Ltd., who are closing
 down that station. On the 29th instant m.t. Peter
arrived with 10 drums of fuel oil, and the next day
 m.l. Irene arrived from Miri towing a lighter with
provisions.

Limbang.
March, 1926.
   Court. — Chan See was sentenced in the District
Court to 18 months' R.I. for theft from a dwelling.
A few days after his incarceration some of the missing
property was found on his person. In the case of
Matjair vs. Bangis, adjourned from the second
ultimo, the charge of theft of a buffalo against
defendant was dismissed. In the Magistrate’s Court
some excitement v .s created by one Salleh bringing
an action for assault against three men and a woman.
All patties, who were from Limpaku Penang, were
fined nominal sums and ordered to produce sureties
to be of good behaviour for six months.
   In the Civil Courts there have been a number
of claims against buffalo owners for damage done by
 their beasts to gardens. The same old question ever
arises, should owners of gardens fence them off
against the buffaloes, or the owners of the buffaloes
fence their beasts in ? Not until it is possible to
make a correct census of buffaloes and a proper
survey of the district whereby it can be calculated
 accurately how much land should be set aside for
 grazing grounds, will it be settled.
   Prison.—Eng Watt, Chroyo, Awang and Ahmat,
 prisoners who broke away from the gang on the 21st
ultimo, have all been recaptured. Three were
arrested on Batu Apoi Estate on information
given by the Manager to the Brunei Police, and one
had found his way back to the Lawas (Sarawak)
Rubber Estate, the scene of the crime for which he
was undergoing a term of imprisonment at the lime
of his escape. All prisoners have been brought up
in Court and sentenced to extra imprisonment and
a flogging. The mandor, hugely through whose
 stupidity these men were allowed to escape, has been
dismissed.
   Medical.—Dr. Farquharson arrived by the Auby
 on the 9th to look into Divisional medical affairs

He inspected the new hospital buildings and the bazaar. He also visited Lawas, Trusan and Sundar, returning to Miri via Labuan, where he called officially on Dr. Furnivall.
  Travelling.—I went over to Labuan on the 9th for the night calling in at Brooketon on my return, where I left instructions for the two large Lancashire boilers to be got ready for towing. I visited Lawas from the 25th to 28th, when I had an opportunity of being shown over the new jelutong refinery by Mr. Gild.
  Marine.—It was necessary to telegraph to the Shipping Master for certain spares for the Sylvia. Whilst she is out of action 1 have been using the Saripah, which launch is now running quite well.
  General, -At the kind invitation of His Highness the Sultan, I went over to Brunei to be present at a farewell tiffin given in honour of Mr. Pretty, the British Resident, who was going on furlough.
  Mr. and Mrs Aplin arrived by the Sulong on the 31st for a visit before proceeding north via Labuan.
  The rainfall recorded is 2'95 inches.
  Owing to the continued spell of dry weather the hill padi and that planted late in the swamp has failed.
  Matusin, the Tuan Belal and Tuah of Menglsita, died on the 22nd from cancer.
  Public Works —The road coolies have been working on the 3rd and 5th mile rounds and have cleaned out the reservoir, which has been dry for some time.
  The prisoners have painted new blinds for His Highness the Rajah's bungalow at Brooketon, cleared sites for two new clerks’ quarters, pulled down the old boat shed and started raising a site for a new one, and carried material for the contractor to site of the new Malay Court House and School. They also rebuilt with nibong the Sylvia's pengkalan.
  Shipping and Trade.—Fifty head of cattle were exported to Kuching.
  The Sulong called in twice from Kuching and the Auby once from Singapore. The launches Peter Duff and Kwong Yick made two and four trips respectively.

  Court.—Court work was very light during the month, most of the people being away on their farms. Chia Teck Choon and Sidik were sentenced to one mouth for breach of Customs Regulations. A Murut slave case was adjourned for further inquiries to be made.
  Crime.—On the night of 15th it was reported that a Javanese coolie named Adul was going round armed with a knife looking for one of the mandors. Police were sent to arrest him. Later a preliminary inquiry was held and Adul was remanded in custody to await trial by the Resident’s Court.
  Prisoners.—The prisoners, averaging 13, were employed on the roads for the greater part of the month. Later they dug another well at the foot of the hill behind the Fort.
  Public Works.— All bridges round the station were repaired. Culverts have been reduced in size to five planks only and the sides boarded up. A culvert on the road beyond the padang was filled in as it appeared to be unnecessary. Muruts turned out for work on the swampy part at the end of the Gaya road. The jungle was felled for a distance of two fathoms from the side of the road which was then corduroyed. Orders were given for a strip of jungle to be felled on each side of the Trusan road. This work will be undertaken by the Muruts living on the roadside. The people of Kampong Gelapas, Trusan, were ordered to fell all their trees within two fathoms of the road. In the past they have frequently been told to keep these trees clear of overhanging branches but have taken no notice, the road being completely covered over in places.
  No tenders have as yet been forthcoming for the erection of the new buildings or construction of new roads sanctioned for this year.
  Travelling.—Datu Haji Moasili, Native Officer, and Ah Lan, book-keeper, arrived from Limbang on 3rd. The Datu came over in connection with the division of the estate of Bilio Usman, late Tua Kampong of Siloateng, while Ah Lan examined the Treasury books.
  Agriculture.—The Lawas (Sarawak) Rubber Estates, Ltd., exported 27,336 lbs. of dry rubber to Labuan. The padi crop has been practically ruined by the long drought and the harvest will be very poor for the third year in succession.
  Forty-nine occupation tickets to plant rubber were issued at Lawas during the month.
  Rainfall.—The drought continued throughout the month, the water shortage becoming acute. After two failures owing to rock the prisoners dug another well behind the Fort which relieved the situation somewhat. The bazaar and kampong people have all been busy digging wells but only about one in five is successful. Fortunately there has been no sickness of any kind, the health of the community being remarkably good. The rainfall recorded was as under:—
         Lawas	...	1'46	inches
         Lawas Estate	...	70	,,
         Trusan	...	79	,,
  Shipping.—M.L. Adele made three trips from Labuan during the month and s.l. Peter Duff one. The usual tongkang sei vice was maintained.
  General.—On 24th I received information from Limbang that four prisoners, all of them from Lawas, had escaped. All sub-stations were warned and a guard posted at Kuala Trusan. One of the men, Ahmat, was recaptured on the estate on 28th. Btauk was sent up river to warn the Muruts, but just after he had left news came through that the other three had been recaptured.
  Mr. G. F. W. Clifford, Manager of the Lawas (Sarawak) Rubber Estates, Ltd., returned from home leave on 28th.

The Acting Assistant District Officer reports
as follows:—
 on 17lb we returned to Lawas, Mr. Anderson stopping until 21st. On 31st, the launch being out of
 order, I went down to Kayangaran in the evening in order to get an early start for Merapok next day.
 During Mr. Anderson’s stay we visited Melipat, re- turning the same day.
    Agriculture.— The Lawas Sarawak Rubber Estates. Ltd., exported 36,158 lbs. of dry rubber to Labuan during the month. As was expected the padi crop is very poor owing to drought, but I am
 told that the Muruts in the UIu Trusan, who  harvested earlier, have had a fair crop.
   Rainfall.—The drought continued but towards  the end of the month there were indications of its  breaking before long. The rainfall recorded was as  under:—
         Lawas	...	1’99	inches.
         Lawas Estate	...	2’83	,,
         Trusan	...	2’56
Court.—In the Resident’s Court at Lawas a Javanese coolie named Adul was sentenced to eighteen months’ R.I. for criminal intimidation. In the Magistrate’s Court, Lawas. Phan Bong, Nudin, and Gapar were fined $5 and Liow Kheh $10 for breach of Forest Regulations, and two runaway Javanese coolies were imprisoned for travelling without passes. At Trusan twenty-one persons were summoned for not having felled their trees by the road side and fines amounting to $171 were imposed. Four Chinese and six Muruts were fined for brawling during Chinese New Year, one of the Chinese being fined $20 in addition for contempt of Court. Ateng Salleh and Asak Sarong were fined $15 and
  Health.—During his stay Dr. Farquharson was unable to find any mosquitoes at Lawas, due no doubt to the fact that their breeding places have all dried up. He made various suggestions regarding drainage which have all been carried out. Yaws is prevalent at Trusan and dysentery at Sundar where water is unobtainable except from the liver. All kampongs were warned and told to boil all water used for household purposes.
  Shipping.- s.l. Peter Duff made two trips from Labuan and s.s. Auby called once at Kayangaran to load timber from Kuching.
$10 for breach of Arms Order. Tax defaulters were summoned and fined. There were several minor ' cases which do not call for mention. At Sundar there were a few minor cases, mostly for breach of buffalo regulations.  Trade. -The trade returns for the follows :—month are asFOREIGN.  Prisoners.—The prison gang, averaging nine, was employed erecting a barbed wire fence round the cattle ground, re-erecting the stable for the mare ? and in the general upkeep of the station.  Lawas.—

On being told that his estimate of $160 per chain, exclusive of stumping,  for the Gaya Road extension was absurd, he re-  turned to Labuan, since when nothing has been heard of him.

   Travelling.—The Resident visited Lawas on 24th, returning to Limbang via Kayangaran on 27th. On 8th I walked to Trusan, measuring all bridges that require repairing. On 10th I heard that Dr. Farquharson and Mr. Anderson were due at Lawas on 12th. I accordingly went down to Sundar on the afternoon of 11th and on to Lawas on 12th in order to meet them. On 14th we went to Trusan via Sundar and on 15th we came down to Sundar again for the night. On 16th Dr. Farquharson left for Limbang in the Sylvia whilst Mr. Anderson and I went down to Awat-Awat in the Saripah Early  Lawas.—
