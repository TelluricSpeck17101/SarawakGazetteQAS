( Contributed.)
On Tuesday April 30th for the first time a football match between a team of Europeans and the 8. P. G. Old Boys was played on the new Recreation Ground.
Unfortunately during the afternoon a heavy shower of rain made the condition of the ground very unfavourable. During the first half of the game tho boys had their work cut out to defend their goal and when the whistle blew for half time neither side had scored. During the second half the play was very even owing to the boys being more or less in training through constant practice.

A Milano Fable.
   Many generations ago there lived in Sungei Hutus,
which flows into the Igan river, a very powerful
Milano chief named Tugau. He had no sons, but
three daughters, or as many accounts say. adopted
daughters. One of these three he married to the
son of Kedahat, ruler of Oya, a man named Jiluan
who lived with his wife in Tugau’s house.
   Thinking he would like a change of diet, Jiluan
one day borrowed Tugau’s golden-headed spear and
went out into the jungle to hunt for pig. After
searching for a long time he at last caught sight of
a beautiful, sleek, white-skinned pig, and crept near
to get a good stab at it, The weapon wounded the
animal, but not very severely, and it went tearing
away with the golden spear blade sticking in its
side, leaving the snapped shaft behind. Jiluan fol-
lowed the tracks for some time, but eventually got
tired of it and returned to the house. When Tugau
heard of the loss of his spear he was very angry
and told Jiluan to go out next day in search of it and
not return until it was found, so early on the next
morning Jillian’s wife got up and cooked 2 days’
provisions for her husband and sent him off on his
quest. He went to the spot at which he had left
the pig's traces on the previous day and then climbed
a tall tree to look round and see the lie of the land.
While up there be heard the noise of people ap-
proaching and, looking down, saw two men walking
along with a very sorrowful aspect. Jiluan called
down and asked them what the matter was. and
they answered that there was trouble in their village
because the daughter of their Raja had been taken
suddenly ill and nobody could cure her. "Who is
your Rajah"? said Jiluan. "The Raja of the pigs"
(Raja baboi) said the men. Then Jiluan began to
climb down the tree, and when be reached ground
be said, “If you will take me to your Rajab, I be-
lieve I can cure bis daughter.”
   The two men then turned back along the nath by
which they had come, and conducted Jiluan to their
village and into the presence of their Raja, who re-
ceived him graciously and agreed to his attempting
the cure of his daughter that same evening. Jiluan
then stipulated that no one except himself should
enter the room where the Raja’s daughter lay ill until
he had either failed or succeeded in curing her, and
also that duriug that time nobody should approach
the house from below. This being agreed to, he
cleared the people out and went to examine the
patient. The Raja’s daughter turned out to be a
very beautiful, fair-skinned girl, but when Jiluan
came to examine her injuries be found Tugau’s
golden spear head sticking in her side. This be ex-
tracted, put into a hollow bamboo joint and threw
down below the house, after which, by his magic
art, he closed and cured the wound it had made.
Then he and the Raja’s daughter began to talk to-
gether and she was so pleased with Jiluan that he
easily persuaded her to run away with him (or as
some versions have it, the Raja gave her to him)
and become his second wife, although by the old
custom only a single wife is allowed. They stole
down from the house and started off before dawn,
Jiluan picking up the golden spear head as he went.
Now between the Raja’s house and that of Tugau
there were several streams to be forded, and when
they reached the first the Raja’s daughter seemed
reluctant to cross it. However she did at last, but
on climbing the opposite hank Jiluan saw that her
feet had lurued to those of a pig. At the next
stream they forded the lady became a pig as far as
the knees, at the next to the waist, and so on, until
just as they were getting near Tugau’s house she
turned to a pig altogether aifd ran off into the jungle
and Jiluan, when he got home and told his story,
was very soundly rated by his proper wife, Tugau’s
daughter, for his conduct in trying to marry the
other lady.
    Thus Jiluan tried to defy the old custom of bis people and marry two wives, and by so doing brought ? no manner of good upon himself but only trouble, as any mau must if he sets at naught the traditionary
I laws handed dqyvn from the people of long ago.
    As a parallel to this story it is worth while comparing the fable of Laboh and the human elephants told in Skcat’s “Malay Magic" pp 151.152 and 153, Chap: V. In it the elephant-princess is wounded by a caltrop instead of a spear: Laboh marries and lives with her some time and they have childen; and finally she is changed back into animal form while going back to Laboh's country with him by eating young tree-shoots with her rice, instead of by contact wi th water while crossi n g rivers. (Con tributed).

THE Native inhabitants of Kuching have this past month been introduced to another Orangputeh’s game hitherto unknown to them.
Several games of Hockey have taken place on the Police Parade ground (by kind permission) and have caused much interest amongst the numbers of spectators assembled, so much so that we understand a hockey Club is to be formed, though we do not think that any game will oust foothall from it's place of first favourite with the Native population.
At present Wednesdays and Fridays are the two days a-week fixed for hockey and generally some 10 to 14 Europeans turn up. It remains to be seen how long the present enthusiasm for the game will last.

       The Expenditure is 1,262,169.81
                   Surplus $65,630.46
     The Revenue has decreased $25,676.86
     The Expenditure has increased 21,646.35
   The principal decreases in thiswear’s revenue have
been in Customs Duties and in Mining Royalties. ,
the former accounted for by the low price of pepper
during the period under review, and the latter owing
to a decrease in the quantity of gold exported, as
well as the higher rate of exchange.
Re veu tie.
Farms.
   These shew a decrease of $3,321.22 and. as last
year, this decrease is attributable to certain of the
Outstation Farms having again fallen.
Stamps.
   Show a decrease of $4,506.20 also accounted for
by the fall in price of pepper, the documents liable
to stamp duty executed during the year relative to
pepper gardens being fewer in number and repre-
senting much smaller sums.
Assessment.
   The increase is the result of the re-adjustment of
the Assessment sanctioned by Your Highness in
1905, and the increase in assessable rental of some
of the town property.
NAVAL DEPARTMENT.
P. S. Adeh.
   The increase in receipts is due to the Adeh having
been in commission during the whole year, whereas
during 1905 she was for some months undergoing
repairs and earning nothing.
P. S. Kaka.
   The decrease is accounted for by the Adeh having
resumed her place, and thus taken some of the work
off the Kaka and consequently reduced the latter's
earnings.
S. L. Alice Lorraine.
   The decrease maj- be attributed to the same cause,
as in the case of p. s. Kaka.
MISCELLANEOUS.
Subsidiary Silver.
   This represents the profit on coining subsidiary
silver issued during the year.
Expenditure.
Public JFarA's and Surveys.
   There is a decrease this year of $22,561.96 in the
expenditure in spite of the many new works that
are in hand. A new system of Street Lighting has
been introduced at a cost of $12,294.19; a new wing
has been added to the Government Offices, the ex-
penditure thereon during the year being $12,249.64,
ing 1905. The whole ’expenditure of the Depart-
ment has been defrayed out of current Revenue.
                  Cession Money.
   A further sum has been paid on account of Luwas.
which increases the expenditure under this head.
                  Immigration.
   This item is made up of the sum of $1,200 paid
by the American Methodist Mission, Singapore, price
of Nai Seong's house at Sibu, and the balance is a
sum paid by the Fou Chou Colonists to account of
Nai Seong's debt.
. Mines.
   These are this year again more satisfactory,
Brooketon showing a decrease in expenditure of
$5,520.92 and Sadong a decrease of $6,921.49. The
output at Brooketon was 20,352 tons and the cost,
exclusive of Capital expenditure, $5.62 per ton. The
output at Sadong was 23,292 tons, and the cost,
as above, $5.58 p4r ton.
                  Plantations.
   Show an increase due to the extension of rubber
planting at Sign and Satap estates.
                  Civil List.
   There is an increase, but this must be expected
as the country expands.
Military.
   The increase here 'is due chiefly to purchase of
now arms to replace those unfit for further use, and
larger expenses of Band.
               Naval Department.
   The cost of p, s. Adeh is this year normal, where-
| as in 1905 heavy expenses were incurred in repairs,
which accounts for the decrease of $6,130.19.
                  Miscellaneous.
   Several plots of land were purchased with Your
Highness’ sanction by the Government and these
are entered under Land Property Account. The
Rest House Account shows an increase in expendi-
ture owing to repairs and furnishings for the newly
opened Outstation Officers’ Rest House.
               .-Lsc/s and Liabilities.
   The amount lodged on fixed Deposit with Singa-
pore Banks is now $200,000 as against $10,000 at
close of 1905. Notes to the value of $8,729 were
withdrawn from circulation during the year.
Staff.
   Mr. Parnell joined the Department as an Assistant
in January. Mr. Lang left in February on appoint-
ment to Simanggang. The Treasurer (The Hon’ble
F. H. Dallas) left the country on leave on the 15th
May, and by Your Highness’ orders T then took
over his duties.
I have the honour to be.
Rajah,
Your Highness’ most obedient servant,
GEORGE C. GILLAN.
Acting Treasurer of Sarawak.

POST, SHIPPING AND CUSTOMS OFFICE.
Kuching, 10th April, 1907.
     RAJAH MI DA. In submitting the annual report of this Department I have the honour to point out that whereas certain items, notably the Customs and Trade returns, show a considerable decrease in dollars, the Sterling value, the only basis on which it is now possible to make any comparison, is the highest yet recorded.
     The Customs Returns are as follows :—IMPORTS.      EXPORTS.      TOTAL.Kuching Outstations     $129,634.28

     In the Post Office there is a further decrease in the sale of stamps again largely due to fewer demands from collectors. The amount of mail handled was about the same as in 1905 while Money orders again show an increase. The Money order system was partially extended to the outstations with the result that, although the number of applications was small, there was no instance of complaint of loss of notes from Registered letters which, before, had been comparatively frequent. Such complaints were always difficult to investigate and in some instances unfounded.
CUSTOMS OFFICE.
     The dollar having been fixed at 2s./4d. and there being a consequent fall in prices it was necessary .to reduce many of the Export Duties more particularly those on Jelutong, Gutta Percha and Pepper. In the export of White Pepper however there was an increase in quantity of piculs 13.000, and of Black of piculs 2,600, the growers finding the preparation of the latter mere profitable than formerly. There was a very large decrease (piculs 21,300) in the Export of Jelotong; this was partially balanced by an increase under India Rubber and Jangkar. This was the first year of export of Jangkar and I hope that in future the returns from this source may to a considerable extent make up the loss on other kinds of Gutta. Sago Flour, in spite of its low price, shows an increase of piculs 40,000. Cutch and Damar show large increases, the latter coming to a great extent from Lawns and Trusan Districts. The total weights of Exports are larger than in 1905.
THE SHIPPING OFFICE.
     Receipts of Steamers and Buoy and Light dues again show small increases, that for the latter being due to the continuous running of the s.-s. Sarawak.
I have the honour to be,
Rajah Muda,
Your Highness’ most obedient and humble Servant,
C. C. ROBISON,
Postmaster General.

.January d February.
   There have been no cases.of any particular importance brought before the Court during these two months; the case of Liin Lioug for claim of third share in a partnership came np again for hearing but was adjourned.
   About eighty Murut men, women and children from Libat Rant’s house in the interior moved down to Suang lately. From all accounts the harvest has been a partial failure in the upper river, though exceptionally good from Tengoa down-wards.
   During my visit in the. latter month there were an usual number of Muruts down from all parts trading principally in damar; it is some years siuce the bazaar has been so full and the Chinese shop- keepers admit that trade is very good.
   Lnder these circumstances there should be no difficulty in the payment of revenue and exemption tax this year.
   The Gazelle left here on the 11th of February for Lawas with a cargo of bilian fencing and attaps. The launch brought from Limbang about 100 planks ? for repairs to barracks etc. for which about 500 more will be required.
   The trade returns for the two months are as follows and compared with corresponding months last year, and those for February show a substantial increase.

O. F. RICKETTS, liesident.

February.
   This month has been particularly noticeable for the numerous complaints lodged by Chinese and others against the Land Dyaks for tin; adulteration of gutta jangka.
   Owing to this many of the traders here have had their gutta returned from Kuching.
, One firm at Simatan had 21 koynns sent back. Evidently this way of working jungle produce has been going on for some time.
   Notwithstanding the number of complaints received only two summonses were issued for breach of the orders relating to adulteration of gutta jangka etc, etc,. Defendants, who in each case were found guilty, were severely punished, as this state of things can only be most injurious to the trade of tho country. With regard to those eases in which summonses were not asked for, the Chinese stated,iithey preferred to settle them out of Court, if possible, as if settled by jurisdiction they would suffer in the long run. should defendants be fined they would be sure to ask their Towkays to advance* pavment, which they were not prepared to do, also they could not afford to lose that time which defendants would spend in gaol in default of the fines". 1 am, however, inclined to think that in some cases the gutta when bought was known to be of an inferior quality and so a very low price was paid; the Chinese themselves trying to impose upon their Towkays in Kuching, thus hoping to make a substantial profit.
   I visited Simatan from the 3rd to the 7th instant going along the coast and returning overland vid Saraian and Sebiris.
   Whilst at Simatan I ordered the arrest of one Masmail, a Sambas Malay, who was suspected of having wantonly wounded four of the Government cattle on the 28th of January. After communicating with Kuching it was decided that there was not sufficient evidence to convict defendant. As Mas- mail is a very bad character and one who appears to disturb the peace of the district in which he lives I


120	THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, MAY 8, 1907.
have, by order of the Hon'ble the Resident, told
Masmail he is to remove at once to Kuching, where
he must live for the future. Of course if he wishes
to remove elsewhere outside Sarawak Territory he
is at liberty to do so.
    A very sad case of poisoning occurred on the |
11th instant at Sibako, when one Lingkin, his wife .
Wang and their four children, with two others, all
residing in the same house, were suddenly taken
sick through having eaten poisonous fungus in mis-
take for mushrooms (kulat tann). Lingkin and his
wife succumbed but the children recovered after
having been in a state of coma (according to native
reports) for over 24 hours.
    I received word from the Court Writer. Simatan,
that on the 24th instant Juli, a Dyak of Sibako, had
been taken by a crocodile at Sungei Samunsam.
Deceased at the time was with four others and all
were wading across the stream on their way to shoot
pig. Two days after a crocodile 15 feet 4 inches
long was caught and a part of Juli's left arm was
found in it's stomach.
    On the 22nd instant Mr. H. H. Everett and Mr.
W. H. Geikie arrived from Santubong.
    Rice and other food stuffs are now almost at
famine prices. About the 15th rfce was being sold
at 2 gantangs a dollar, and towards the end of the
month shopkeepers had stopped selling it altogether.
It will go very hard with a great many if Suhnt's
bandong which is daily expected does not arrive
soon. No large boat has been in since the 14th
December 1906. Although there are a number of
small boats running between here and Kuching in
the landas, the rice they bring is not nearly sufficient
to meet the demands of the inhabitants.
    The bridge at Stuuggang. mentioned in last
month’s report, has been completed, and at no cost
to Government. Although not made of bilimn, a
. strong wood (chengal) has been used which should
last 20 years.
   The trade returns are as appended.

this occasion.
F. F. BOULT.
Assistant Resident.
     Upper Sarawak paku.
February.
   Planting.—No new pepper gardens have been registered this month. In fact only 7 have lieen registered since middle of last year. In accordance with instructions from His Highness the Rajah I began an inspection of the pepper gardens of Upper Sarawak on the 18th and during the rest of the month did the Ayer Panas, Kladi. Jugan and Seni- awan Sebrang gardens. The best of these are those at Senia wan Sebrang. Round Ayer Panas, Kladi and Jugan a large number of gardens have been abandoned and in many others the vines were suffering from want of burnt earth.
   The attendance at the Government school having become very small it was closed at end of month and the schoolmaster having received due notice was discharged.
   I am told that 285 tons of antimony were delivered at Busau during January. This exceptional quantity was obtained in consequence of Chinese New Year falling in middle of this month.
   The prisoners were engaged on the usual upkeep of roads. During the latter part of month they
were levelling off the top of a hill on Seniawan road
and improving the gradient.
A rather unusual occurrence happened near Seni-
awan during month. One Chang Pit, while going
to bathe, was attacked by a crocodile which was lying
beside a big batang on the bank. He escaped with
a few bites and scratches on the thighs and legs.
March.
I continued the inspection of pepper gardens
which took me till end of month. Finding it difficult
to spare sufficient time from my ordinary work to go
round all the pepper gardens in Bau district as well
as Paku I obtained permission for Mr. Collins to
accompany me on several occasions, so that he will
be enabled to assist me by examining most of the
Bau gardens by himself.
The Serambu Dyaks living at Podam asked per-
mission to clear some land at Jugan for paddi plant-
ing at a place where seveial gardens had been
abandoned. Abang, Amit was sent with them to-
examine the land and.the Abang who sometime ago
made a map of the Jugan gardens was thus able to
point out to me on the map exactly where the Dyaks
wished to plant. I did not think it advisable, how-
ever, to allow them to use the land as they would
have considerably encroached on the little jungle
remaining to certain gardens still in cultivation.
There is a haunted hill near by, but neither Dyaks
nor Chinese will cut any wood on it.
    The Chinese schoolmaster who was formerly at
Kranji has opened a school in the Bazaar here and
has 18 boys on his books. I understand it is his
intention to apply for a Government grant if his
school becomes a going concern. I think it would
be a good thing to give him a small grant and allow
him to charge a small monthly fee as then the
parents would see that their children attended school.
Another school was opened at Seniawan at end of’
month to teach English and Chinese, but at present
I know no particulars, but it appears to have been,
started by the 8. P. G.
    The spring pepper crop is now coming on and
several robberies by gangs of Chinese armed with
nibong spears have been reported. As yet no clue
to the thieves has been obtained. This gang (or
gangs) not only takes the dried pepper from the
houses but also the green pepper and the pepper in
soak. Two men were arrested during month and
sentenced to imprisonment for being in possession
of pepper for which they could not account, and I
have no doubt they were connected with this gang.
    On the 22nd I held Court in the police station at
Busau and heard case of Lim Tek Ho r. Khim Soon.
Deft, was charged with sending Pitff. a very disgust-
ing and libellous anonymous letter. Deft, was found
guilty and sentenced in accordance with instructions-
of the Hon’ble the Resident to one year’s imprison-
ment and 12 strokes of rattan.
    On 29th I went to Kuching for the tuba fishing.

March.
    On the 4th I sent Tuanku Hamid, Native officer,,
to visit the Dayaks in the Poyut and neighbouring
streams to investigate certain charges of improper
conduct and injustice brought by Ngabong against
Penghnlu Kalang. He was away for a few days and
on his return informed me that he had been unable


THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, MAY 3, 1907.
to find any truth whatsoever in these charges. Ngabong was informed that if he did not behave himself in the future he would be expelled from the
   9“ 9?® ?th two Dayak prisoners named Abong and Sedin escaped from the jail 'dapor' early in the morning. The alarm was at once given, but although search parties beat all the jungle round about for the next 4 days, no trace of them was discovered. On the 14th however Ali, captain of the s. 1. Lucile, reported that the fugitives had been seen making their way upriver at Long Lama. I at once sent off a paity of Police under L. C. Banyong and with the assistance of Penghulu Tama Wan Bayer they came up with the runaways at the Uma Pawa house below Long Akar. On being ordered to surrender, Abong at once attacked the police and had to be shot down; Sedin ran away into the jungle but gave himself up the next day and is now in jail, having received the usual penalty for breaking jail.
   I very much regret that Abong lost his life, but he was a very bad character ami l*ad told me personally, when 1 arrested him last December for threatening to kill a Kenyah and for disobedience of Government orders, that on his release from jail he would not rest until he had revenged himself on the Kenyahs and Dayaks who had effected his arrest. It was only by the alertness of the Police that he was prevented from carrying out his threat.
   On the 17th I received news from the Writer of Sibuti that the whole of the bazaar there had been burnt down on the night of the 10th. Every shop was destroyed as well as a large number of rattans ready for shipment to Sarawak.
   The fire was due to the usual carelessness of •Chinese in not properly putting out their kitchen fires at night.
   There has been a lot of Court work during the month. One Seman of Niah was sentenced to a year’s imprisonment for theft.
   Sureng and Awang, Batu Blahs, were fined $30 for absconding to Balait and Awang $30 more for drawing a parang in a quarrel with a Punan. These Were the most important cases.
   The UmaPch Kayans and Muriks and Batu Blah Kenyahs paid in their tax during the month amounting in all to $810.
   There has been a tremendous lot of rain and for ten days the whole of the country round was several feet under water owing to the heavy flood in the river. Advantage has been taken of this, and large quantities of rattans have been brought down from upriver. There must be now 30,000 bundles in the Bazaar ready for shipment. The p. s. Adeh made her first trip of the year to this station on the 10th. She was very welcome, as there was a great want of foodstuffs in the bazaar. She returned to Kuching on the 13th with a valuable cargo of rubber worth over $50,000. She made another trip on 21st by which Mr. J. T. Chynoweth arrived to do duty at this station.
   The s. 1. Lucile left on the 31st for Kuching to undergo docking and other repairs. This should be a lengthy job, so I hope a launch will be sent here to take her place for the time.
   The prisoners have finished the New Hoad joining the Bazaar and Limbang Roads and have made a very good job of it, which tends to improve the appearance of the place. They have also been employed in heightening all the paths on the Government Hill.
   The fortmen have whitewashed and tarred the Fort and Barracks, whilst the Police have done the same to the Police station and their married -quarters.
   The rainfall for the month amounted to 418 inches.

During the month coolies have been employed in handling young coffee, scraping moss from coffee stem, weeding and plucking tea.
A gang of coolies also have been put on to weeding, draining and repairing Pengkailan road.
The balance of last year’s coffee (48 piculs) was despatched to the Borneo Company Limited.
Tea manufactured during the month were 236 tbs. and no picking of coffee was done this month as there was not much ripe fruu on the trees to gather and shall begin to pick early next month.
Mr. Grove paid coolies’ wages for February on the 5th instant.

RAJAH MUDA,—I have the honour to submit to you my report on the Military Department for month of March 1907.
Strength of the Regiment.—The total number of non-commissioned officers and men is four hundred and fifty six.
During the past month five men have been discharged by Your Highness’ orders; all of them are very bad characters, and the regiment will be all the better without them.
Five recruits joined and one man signed on for a further term of service.
Conduct.—During the past month there have been again a good many eases of men selling their uniform. Since Y’our Highness’ order that any man

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, MAY 3, 1907,
so doing would receive a term of three months imprisonment has been impressed upon the men, however. by the fact that four of them are in jail for this offence, this has almost censed, as on these terms the selling of Government uniforms is hardly profitable to the seller.
   No other serious crimes have occurred during the past mouth.
   Health. In accordance with instructions received all tiie men now at headquarters are being sent to the 1*. M. O. to be vaccinated; so far fifty-six men have been done, and in the majority of cases have taken very well.
   Barracks.— Work has been delayed on the repairing of the small Bachelors quarters owing to our not being able to get planks; by the end of the present month, however, this house should be finished at latest.
   General.—In accordance with usual custom drills have been suspended for the past fortnight in order to enable us to whitewash the fort and barracks throughout. This has now been 'finished and the drills have been resumed.
   Mr. Scott, the Instructor, having been granted six months furlough by His Highness the Rajab, sailed for Singapore on the 2nd April.
I have nothing further to report.
I have the honour to be,

March.
   During the month several parties of Dyaks have been turned back from going to Belaga where it is evident they arc trying to collect to make a raid on the Kayan country: from Balanian alone 61 men have been stopped, also a small party of Muka Dyaks. and it is evident that the idea of this raid is disturbing the Dyaks all along the coast.
   The Exemption tax for the District has all been collected and the Dyaks are now paying in theirs; they have had an exceptionally good harvest.
   1 left on the 24th for Tatau and arrived there at 10 i>. M. Next morning the court was full of Dyaks bringing up various cases; as they were mostly cases for the Penghulus 1 got the Penghulus to settle them on the spot.
   The Penghulus complained that the Dyaks were moving up iuto the heads of the branch streams and also up above the Bukitans in the main river; these latter 1 sent for and ordered them to come down river and live below the Sana, the original boundary.
   Several complaints were brought up against one Geiani who appears to have received a lot of goods from Dyaks on the understanding that he would cure them of small-pox, saying no one who was under his care would die; some children put under his care died and the parents tried to recover what they had given him. I told the Penghulus that they were to bring up their evidence agamst Geiani in two days time, meanwhile another charge was brought against him of having medicined a child by pouring hot water into its mouth, which killed it, and when Geiani was sent for to come to Court he was found to have fled and was said to have got to Balanian.
   The Penghulus asked that Geiani should be turned out of the river in the event of his returning.
   The baxaar at Tatau which was completely destroyed by fire last October has not been rebuilt and
the traders are now living in small attap sheds; only I men intend to put up new shops and are now collecting the timber for them, mostly billian.
   A lot of Court work was put through, mostly Debt Court, and a number of outstanding fines collected; the last of the fines for the men who joined in Rumahs Kayan raid were paid in also.
   I took 4 prisoners to Tatau and put them on to repair the road and build a landing stage with the aid of a Malay carpenter. At Bintuhi the prisoners were employed in whitewashing various buildings and repairing roads.
   The Imports amounted to $5,234 and Exports to $9,377.

March.
   Agreements 43 haye been made out during the- month. Stamp duties and fees amounted to $ 119.65.
Court Fines and fees amounted to $115.00.
   There is nothing of importance to report for the past month.
   A good deal of Mr. Collins' time has been taken up assisting the Resident of Paku with the inspection of pepper gardens : he went to Kuching on the 23rd and again on the 29th as the Tuba fishing was postponed.
   Dr. Barker was in the district on the 7th and 8th instant and Dr. Bruce Low on the 13th, 14th, 15th,. 22nd, 23rd, 28th, 29th.
   Pa Satis, a Singghi Dyak. was badly wounded by a bear which attacked him after lie had shot it and was about to despatch its cubs, he was treated in the Bau Hospital for nearly a month.
   The School started again on the 1st with a total of 38 boys attending: the Masters at present consist of a junior one for the Chinese class and a Malay to teach that language and preliminary classes in English and Arithmetic.
   It has been difficult to find labour at a reasonable figure to clear the roads which I wished to have done by contract for the year or on monthly wages. I was unable to get any Chinese at 50 cents a day and the amounts asked for a monthly contract were absurd; it is quite evident to me that coolies at any rate are not suffering from the fall in pepper or there would be more looking for work at. a reasonable figure.

Resident 2nd Class.
SIMANGGANG
March.
   Ulu Ai affairs.—Whilst I was at Betong on the 25th Penguin Dimpi reported that a small party of his people, from Tuga, who were out after bees’ nesta in the Ulu Entabai were attacked on the 21st whilst asleep at night in their hut.
   Their surprise was complete and two were killed and three got away wounded. The enemy numbered sixteen and made off in the direction of Lanjer Hill. The pursuit, owing to the distance, was ineffectual.
   P. Nyamba of L. Antu died of hemorrhage on the 27th. I have directed his cousin Baja to hold the Penguluship for the present.
   I learnt on March 3rd (when at Kabong) that the three Chinese Secret Society prisoners—Tau Ah Long, Chua Ah Khoon and Chong Ah Lee—who-


THE SARAWAK GAZETTE. MAY 3, 1907.
123
had escaped from L. Antu on February 17th, had been accounted for by the Dyaks of Una’s house near Rantau Panjai after an interval of four days
   The report made to me is that these Dyaks called upon the prisoners to surrender their weapons and they refused to do so and resisted arrest, whereupon they were cut down; one Dyak had a slight wound. None of the Dyaks had spears. These Chinese had been warned of this fate, both at Simanggaug by myself and at L. Antu by Mr. Lang, should they attempt escape whilst in the 2nd Division.
   Miscellaneous "fain.—Mr. II. L. Owen, the Assistant Resident, returned from leave, arriving at Lingga in the s. s. La Fee on the 23rd February and reaching Simanggaug the following afternoon.
   At Kabong, before going up to Saratok, I held •Court upon six occasions.
   The new Dyak Chiefs P. Engkamat and P. Sumping of the Sablak (both young men) were present.
   The Sedio (Saratok) murder case was the principal matter of interest.
   The mixed Jury, consisting of gix Malays and three Chinese, disagreed, and I hud to dismiss them and release Dobut and Merejeng (the men accused of the planned, cold-blooded murder and robbery of the unfortunate Chinese Trader Kang Ah Chim of Saratok Bazaar).
   I consider that I made a mistake in calling a Jury to assist me in this trial.
   The Malay by his up-bringing and nature is not qualified to serve on a Jury; he does not understand the trust and confidence that are reposed in him in that responsible position—a position which is so opposed to all his ideas and traditions. He considers that it is the duty of those governing to see to and settle cases, and to exercise the right of governing, and he fails to understand why he should Ire dragged out of his own groove of every day life to assume the position of a judge of his fellow men, for which ride neither his heart nor head are fitted. He is naturally suspicious—there being so much in this world that he cannot understand—and so suspects that some responsibility is being shifted on to his shoulders by those who are unwilling to take it on their own. I must say that I am writing of the Malays of this Division (though what I have written may well apply to Malays elsewhere), and 1 should add that I feel for them and quite sympathise with them in that they have not yet grasped the working of the Jury system.
   On March 7th cash §600 in silver was safely transmitted from the Kabong to the Simanggang Treasury and later on I brought round (vid Betong) §400, making the Total §1.000.
   In the matter of the goods of one Taha, a Saratok Malay (absconded), I gave directions that the few goods left should be taken possession of for the benefit of his creditors.
   Abang Bujang of Paioh came to me with a dirty, sea-stained document, covered with Malay scribbling and jiniat, and dated 56 years ago; it bore the chop of H. H. The Rajah (Sir James) but I could see no signature. This the Abang said his grandfather (Abang Gadong) had received from Inche Boyang (by order) to shew that he had purchased certain durian trees from some Bembas Dyaks at N. Dulang, and these trees had been inherited by the present holder of this document. He continued to explain that when he was away in Brunei his Agent (Awang J air) climbed these trees but was stopped by the Dyaks who then claimed the trees as their own.
   On reference being made to the Pusa Court Books it was found that on April 23rd 1899, before the Acting Resident, Awang Jairfailed toprove that he had any right to trees at N. Dulang as all those formerly owned by Abang Gadong were dead. There was no ?question raised that he lost his case because this
document was not forthcoming as Abang Bujang now alleged. Furthermore, a letter from the Ptisa chief confirmed the fact that the trees claimed by the Malays had died.
   Abang Bujang then asserted that his trees wore still alive but produced no evidence. It was pointed out to him that he could have appealed long before this if he had a real case; he was deliberately re-opening a settled case and trying to deceive the Court.
   The document was confiscated and the Abang fined $15.
   I went up to Saratok on the 7th and held Court there on five days. The usual Dyak cases occupied most of the time and none of them were remarkable.
   Haji Ali with a small Kampong (4 houses) applied for a piece of Government land at Tanjong Batu where he lives. He is anxious to ditch and plant the inland part and farm the melai land on the banks. This land which has now only two small sago clumps on it is marked Nos. 1 and 3 in the Government sago lx>ok and I have allowed the applicants to occupy it provided Your Highness sees no objection.
   P. Dunggat reported that on his way to Saratok to attend Court on March 2nd he heard that a Dyak of Budu had been killed by a pig-trap. Neither the tuai runiah nor the man who set the traps made any report and I had twice to issue a summons untH they appeared before me at Simanggaug uud were duly fined and a pati nyawa or compensation of $50 (or an old jar) awarded to the nearest relation of the person killed.
   There were several Dyak applications for permission to buy guns, and. seeing that so many dangerous traps for pigs and deer arc constantly being set because those farming have no fire-arms, I am of opinion more should be allowed.
   I left Saratok soon after 4 A. M. and reached Ka- bong before 9 A. M.
   Court was held here upon five occasions; several Chinese cases from the Boban were inquired into. There have been fights amongst the Ibus Chinese (the Liew Cbiew Chinese) and I sentenced one mau who was fined in December for the same offence to a term of imprisonment and warned him that if he repeats this when released he will be turned out of the river.
   In checking the Defaulter’s Book I found a number of fines, mostly Dyaks, still owing fur 1906, and Mr. A. E. Cheyne informed me that he had been unable to press these people because they had been so hard up for food just before this harvest and had been wording sago. Now that the harvest is coming in I expect the majority of these fines to be paid in full, and have given instructions to that effect.
   The Chinese carpenters had practically finished the repairs to the Saratok Bungalow (?with the exception of the inside partitions which I had patched up) so I ordered them to Kabong where there are some few repairs required to the roofr'fof Fort, cookhouse, and cow-house), the rain-gutters, and furniture in the Officers' Quarters. This work should be finished soon after the end of March when the carpenter (Sam Jun) and his assistant—a prisoner—will proceed to Betong to execute some small repairs there to the roofs of Fort and cook-house.
   I find that the quarters of the chiefs and Police at Saratok must be entirely rebuilt and this is to be put in hand early in April. 1 propose to make use of some of the extra bilian wood I have over from the Bungalow repairs for the frame work of the building, the roof and walls of which will be of leaf and ba put up by the Kampong people at a small cost.
   The Kalaka Clerk has instructions to auction tho Estates (pepper gardens) of Lim Ah Lan, Chia Fook Soi, and Yio Ah Seng, all of Boban, at the Bazaar during this month of March, and also to examina

the Chinese gardens in the Ibus, which stream has not been lately visited by any Government servants.
   The raising of the main road from the bridge over S. Kabong Besar to the sands (about 440 yards in all). and the clearing (iebait)crf the inland track from the cattle-house to the small bridge over 3. Lembu are works th.it require taking in hand, but I do not vet see how they arc to be done as 1 have no prison labour to spare from Simanggang. It is really important to keep these two tracks open for foot- passengers as a number of the poorer people of Kabong obtain their livelihood from what they collect along the sands, such as firewood, damar gum, shells for lime, shell-fish (scnaga and ambalj sea-worms (Wan,) crabs—both common crabs and king-crabs (blangkasi the eggs of which at this season are greatly appreciated by the natives—the eggs of the bluktt or river-turtle, which visit the sandy stretch ofcoast between Kabong and Alit in numbers and lay an enormous number of eggs which always sell locally at from 1.J to 2 cents each (and are. to those who know, a greater dainty than the sea-turtle's penyau eggs,) then, more rarely, are the eggs of the penyau sisit, and shrimps and prawns can always be caught, with other small fish, with light seine nets. In addition to these wave-borne gifts which the poor, the old, the weak, and even little children collect at every tide when the roads to the sand can be easily traversed, many Malays plant on the coast both paddy and vegetables, sugarcane. water-melons, cladium, and so forth, most useful and indeed necessary food for the health of the fish-eating population of Kabong.
   On March 20th I was at Pusa and held Court. There was nothing particular to notice there except that the clearing of the Government cocoa-nut Plantation leaves much to be desired and 1 fear many of the trees are going back.
   I returned to Betong on 23rd and held Court there on two days.
   I started on my walk back on the 26th at 3 A. M. and arrived at Simanggang at the early hour of 10.15 A. M.
   Tuanku Putra who was ill before 1 left Simang- gaqg on February 15th has now returned to duty. I am glad to say.
   Penguin Jelani of Bintulu I found at Simanggang. Ue wanted to re-open an old property case which had been settled (correctly) by Panget an Metali many years ago, and furthermore was trying to get people to move to Bintulu to increase his following and add to his importance. I ordered him to return to Bintulu by the first boat, which he did.
   I sent Abang Haji Mohamat Ali (Chek) to Lubok Antu to take his son’s place for a month, as he has leave for that time in order to rebuild his house at Simanggang.
   Mr. Baring-Gould reports that whilst 1 was away a Chinaman of Batu Kudi by name Chan Then Fui was taken by a crocodile when swimming after his boat in the main river. A Dyak girl was drowned in the Ulu Sepak owing to the fresh.
   The Kampong Malays completed the building of the new Kumpang boat for the Government.
   The prisoners cleared the Sabu-Temudok road, the Palm oil Plantation at first 1st mile, and cleared and manured part of the cattle land at the hilir end of Simanggang.
   The weather whilst 1 was absent was very wet and unpleasant; it is feared that the harvest has suffered owing to the unusually prolonged wet weather.
   I have nothing further to report for the mouth that has passed.

   On the 18th Saribu and about thirty Adang Muni ts came down from Madihit with produce. Amongst other matters Saribu requested to be allowed to go on the warpath over the nordcr, and quoted the case of some Barnin people who had been allowed to do sb, which of course was incorrect. They have as far as is known no particular reason for going on the warpath anywhere and it is most probable that they have been induced to make this request by some Dyaks.
   Ail the Adangs with the exception of two houses have now m .ved down from the Adang river to the Madihit district.
   On the 19th Mr. Ward left for Madihit and Sungei Mago to visit the Murata in those parts, collect revenue and such like. He received ins true lions to make inquiries ns to whether any Dyaks hud incited Saribu and his followers to go on the warpath and, if such was proved, to.send them down to the station under arrest.
   There has been very little going on in the Court during the month the, harvesting still being in progress. In the case of the jars valued at $600, the property of a Sarawak Malay name^ Bujeng, no trace of them has been discovered, and those in charge of them have been made responsible, the simplest precautions for their safety having been npglected by them.
   Al the commencement of the month I was away at Biooketon, returning here on the 7tb, and on the 21st left for Trusan returning here on the 28th.
   On the 29th about 11 p. M. a fire broke out in the kampong close to the lower sago factory; the fire was luckily put out before much damage was done. The inmates came next morning and complained that some one had tried to burn the house, at the fire started on the outside, and from all appearances such was the case, but so far nothing has come to- light as to who the culprits were.
   The trade returns shew the following figures for the month.
     Coasting Imports $6,037, Exports $7,606.
     Foreign ..	8,780.	,,	7,919.

   This appointment is subject to Your Highness’s approval.
   Some of the low river Kampongs have been engaged in working “Simpor" wood for the various parts of the Native Chiefs house.
   Considerable but unavoidable delay is being caused in the erection of this building owing to the difficulty experienced in procuring the services of a reliable carpenter.

   On the 3rd Dobut and Mrejing who had been kept in detention in Simanggang Jail suspected of being the Sedio murderers arrived in custody of P. C. Tamin of Lingga. Their case came up before the Gonrt on the 4th and 5th when they were acquitted. P. C. Tamin returned to Lingga on the 7th.
   On the 7th the Resident accompanied by the Native Officers, Abang Dul andHj. Dullah. and myself left for Saratok. No case of importance came up for settlement, there were only ordinary ones.
   News was brought down by some I. hi Krian Dyaks that Lubun was accidentally killed by his and his brother-in-law’s pig trap. P. Dnliggat who had already came down in order to meet the Resident was not present in the Budu when this occurred.
Neither the trapper nor the "tuai rumah” came
to report this death until they were sent for by
“tongkat" and ordered to proceed to Simanggang.
The Resident returned to Kabong on the 13th and
on the 20th to Simanggang vid the Saribas.
   The carpenter came down on the 17th to do some
repairs to this bungalow as he has finished repair-
ing the Saratok bungalow.
   On the 27th an Alit Malay came to report that
four Chinese prisoners escaped from Sibu Jail (one
was overtaken at Nyabor) and were last seen on
the coast between Alit and Gamuroh. No traces of
them can lie found after as there are no-strangers or
new comers at Boban on inquiries having been made.
Probably they have gone on by boat.
   The sum of one thousand dollars was transmitted
to the Simanggang Treasury.
   The hauls of the pengireh have been very large,
but now the fishermen are commencing to go to
Smudam : the jungiiat fishermen are commencing to
search for rattans to make their nets with.
   On the 27th I proceeded to Roban as ordered by
the Resident in order to auction two pepper gardens
and a shop-house. I visited all the Chinese huts
and gardens in llie Ibus, as these people are con-

Several cases of thefts too occurred and were reported.
