Mr. Ong Kheng Siang and brothers thank their friends and 
relatives for attending the funeral of their father, the late 
Mr. Ong Tiang Siew, and also those who sent scrolls or 
rendered assistance in their bereavement.
NOTES.
  His Highness the Rajah was received by 
the King at Buckingham Palace on June 27, 
when His Majesty conferred upon him the 
honour of Knighthood, and invested him 
with the Insignia of a Knight Grand Cross 
of the Most Distinguished Order of St. 
Michael and St. George.
  His Highness the Tuan Muda, accom- 
panied by the Dayang Anne and Mr. H. B. 
Crocker, Acting Chief Secretary, left by 
H.H.M.Y. Maimuna on the 6th on a visit 
to the northern stations of the State, and 
returned on the 16th. Incidentally, this is 
the first occasion on which the Dayang Anne 
has had the opportunity of seeing outstation 
life, and we are sure there were many things 
which appealed to her interest during the 
short tour.
  WE understand that His Highness the 
Tuan Muda expects shortly to pay a visit to 
Baram.
  His Highness the Tuan Muda will hold a 
review of the Sarawak Rangers at the Fort 
Parade Ground on His Highness the Rajah's 
Birthday, 26th September, and will after- 
wards present Long Service Medals and 
Decorations to those deserving Government 
servants who have been awarded these marks 
of recognition of their loyal services. Every- 
body who wishes to witness this interesting 
ceremony is cordially invited to be present.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, SEPTEMBER 1, 1927.
  CAPTAIN C. P. Lowe and, Mr. G. T. M. Mac 
Bryan returned on the 5th by H.H.M.Y. 
Maimuna from Singapore, whence they had gone 
in connection with official duties.
  WE extend a hearty welcome to Dr. and Mrs. 
Clark H. Yeager who arrived on the 1st. Dr. 
Yeager has been nominated by the International 
Health Board of the Rockefeller Foundation to 
co-operate in the organization of the Health 
Department in Sarawak.
  MR. A. Humphreys arrived on the 15th to 
assume the duties of Electrical Engineer, Sibu. 
Mr. W. L. Clark, Assistant, Government 
Electricity Department, also returned from home 
leave on the same date.
   THE Kuching Fire Brigade was recently 
called out to attend to an outbreak of fire at
Mr. Hayward's residence and was able to render 
valuable service in extinguishing the fire before it 
could cause any disastrous results.
   A regatta will be held at Simanggang on the 
4th and 5th September, and we hope it will turn 
out to be a great success.
   IN the Government Gazette of the 1st  
September is contained some new legislation for 
the protection of labour. Mr. G. T. M. MacBryan 
is appointed to officiate as Protector of 
Netherlands Indian Labourers in accordance with 
the provisions of the new Netherlands Indian 
Protection Labour Order.
  MR E. H. Holl, Director of Agriculture, and 
Mr. N. A. Middlemas, Superintendent of 
Surveys, were away from headquarters on duty 
connected with their respective departments
  MR. E. Banks. Curator of the Sarawak 
Museum, has gone on a visit to the headwaters of 
the Rejang in search of new specimens.
  CAPTAIN E. V. Andreini, Acting District 
Officer, returned to Kapit after a visit to the Apu 
Kayan, which was undertaken with the object of 
discussing border and Dyak affairs with the 
Dutch Government authorities
  MR. W. Duncan, Controller of Government 
Monopolies, paid a short visit to Singapore 
during the month.
  MR. F. D. Haigh arrived on the 9th to relieve 
Mr. R. W. Chater who is proceeding on home 
leave in the very near future. Mr. Haigh has been 
gazetted Deputy Superintendent of the Printing 
Office.
  AMONG the passengers who landed from the 
s.s. Angby on the 22nd was Mrs. Butler, who has 
come to visit her parents, Captain and Mrs. W.T. 
Clark.
   WE learn that Mr. H. D. Aplin, Divisional 
Officer, First Division, will shortly be going on 
transfer to Miri as Acting Resident of the Fourth 
Division, vice Mr. C. E. Ermen who is proceeding 
on home leave, while Mr. F. H. Kortright, District 
Officer, Upper Sarawak, is coming to Kuching to 
act as Divisional Officer, First Division.
   THE triennial Council Negri has been pro-
visionally fixed to take place on the 17th 
October, subject to the approval of His Highness 
the Rajah.
   A committee has been formed, with Mr. H. 
D. Aplin as Chairman, with the object of 
providing for arrangements for the reception and 
accommodation of native members of the 
Council Negri from the outstations. The 
Committee have under consideration a pro-
gramme which includes a trip of sight-seeing by 
the outstation native members in the metropolis 
and its outskirts. 
   
   THE large number of Sarawak boys and girls 
attending Singapore schools who have returned 
during the month to spend their summer holidays 
here shows a conspicuous tendency of local 
interest for a higher standard of education.
THE Datu Bandar, Haji Abdillah, and party 
returned from a private tour of the Federated 
Malay States on the 29th.
   MAJOR F. W. Richards, General Manager of 
the Sarawak Oilfields, Limited, Miri, is expected 
in Kuching on the 4th September on a visit.



THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, SEPTEMBER 1, 1927.	22!
  THE new Treasury, facing the old Govern-
ment Offices in India Street, was put into 
occupation as from the 1st. It is a spacious and 
imposing structure, with a floor that is entirely 
laid out with marble slabs imported from Italy, 
and the floor of the surrounding verandah, being 
constructed of red tiles, gives an effective 
contrast in colour design.
  THE old Treasurer's room has been converted 
into a small Court for holding the Resident's and 
Supreme Court, and a verandah is being added in 
order to render it more commodious and 
convenient of access to the public. The old 
Treasury is being occupied by the Divisional 
Office and District Office, whilst the Assistant 
Secretary's Office has now removed to the old 
Divisional Office, to which a verandah is also 
being attached to make for better 
accommodation. The Education Department is 
now located in the offices formerly allotted to 
the Assistant Secretary's Office. These 
alterations are necessitated by the continual 
expansion of the various Government 
Departments. The problem of office 
accommodation, we think, will make itself more 
seriously felt in the not distant future, and unless 
a modern administrative building of two or three 
storeys is constructed to house all Departments 
under one roof, the business of the Government 
will have to be conducted in offices scattered all 
over the town.
  WE much regret to learn of the death on 19th 
August, at Tayport, Dundee, of Mr. G. D. 
Melville.
  Mr. Melville was many years Chief Engineer 
of s.s. Kuching of the Sarawak Steamship 
Company and also many years in the Service of 
the Singapore-Sarawak Steamship Company.
  He had a wide circle of friends who were 
hoping for his return to Sarawak.

Notes by a Commentator on the 
following lines in the year 3562.
I. Under the spreading chestnut tree The village smithy 
stands;
The smith a mighty man is he, With large and 
sinewy hands;
5. And the muscles of his brawny arms Are strong as iron 
bands.
His hair is black and crisp and long, His face is 
like the tan;
      His brow is wet with honest sweat,
I0. He earns whate'er he can, And looks the whole world 
in the face. And owes not any man.
1.	''Chestnut tree'' -a rare tree of the coniferous variety 
of the family "Mensa tablis," the fruit of which 
would appear to have been kept in large steel 
chests, which gives it its name.
2.	"Smithy "--Perhaps the abode of the "Smith" or 
"Smisk"- what he was doing and why he was here 
we do not know. The whole passage is extremely 
obscure
3.	The text here is hopelessly corrupt and defies 
emendation. The Schol. gives no help.
5. 	"Muscles"-An obvious error for "Mussels," a kind 
of shell-fish much eaten by the nobility of the age. 
cp. a former king of this country dying through 
excess of a similar fish. Parasinus A ''muscatels" 
may be disregarded.
"Brawny"- A later editor's mistake for the word 
"browny" Bentley, with his usual learning, 
proposes "breezy" on no grounds whatever.
6.	"Band"-This word has defied scholars of all ages 
and is the sole instance of its use. Theobald 
proposes "iron sands." This is thoroughly 
paradoxical and his suggestion may be considered 
negligible.
There is a break here in the narrative, as may be 
seen upon scrutiny; in all probability, a second 
narrative has crept in, as the next four lines are 
rather incompatible with the former narrative.
7.	"Hair" Hobnob unnecessarily proposed "Stair " This 
suggestion may be disregarded.
"-and black and long."-Better " Both black but 
long."
8.	The M S.S. has "His face is like the Swan." This is 
the more feasible of the two, the word "swan" 
probably being an ancient form of the word 
"Swain" or "swack" which we know to be derived 
from the Lithuanian "Szofl," the meaning of which 
is very obscure. Both passages are however, most 
probably corrupt.
9.	Here begins the passage, well-known to scholars as 
the "Lesser Exterpolation', It continues till line 11. 
cp. Introduction para. H.
"With honest sweat." This man had been working.
10.	Hobnob proposes "steal" for "earns." This 
suggestion seems feasible.
Whate'er" Scholars are divided as to the 
significance of the curious small mark over the 
"e," the third letter, as it is thought, of the ancient 
Anglican alphabet. Bentley futilely imagines that it 
was merely caused by the scholiast sharpening his 
"penzyl" or writing instrument!



222
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, SEPTEMBER 1, 1927.
11.	A hopeless oxymoron. How could a single 
man look the whole world (i.e. either the actual 
earth or everybody inhabiting the earth) in the 
face? These uncivilized barbarians did not 
know that the earth was tetrahedronical, but 
imagined it to be a sphere. The text would 
therefore appear incorrect. Nor does the Pesh. 
give any help. It is probable that this is another 
piece of narrative interpolated by a latter editor 
of, perhaps, the 26th century.
12.	The Laurentian M S.S. has: "For he bowes not 
any han " On the contrary, B. Bernensis 363, 
which is followed by an ancient document 
bearing the names of Hobs and Sutliv has"For 
she hoes nat any land ' (Hoeing, whatever it 
was, appears to have been a common 
custom.) This is borne out by the reference in 
Liber Moldavicanus, recently unearthed in 
Stoshawhangbar by Lewis and Hobnob, to 
"Shoeing." By the omission of the first and 
fourth letters and a simple transposition of the 
words, we obtain the following, which makes 
good sense: - "She lands not any for-shoes." 
Now by merely omitting a letter here and 
there, this will be seen to refer to the Smith in 
line 2 This is borne out by Codex Boned, in 
the Eiffel Tower, Parix.
This knowledge will not, of course, be required by any 
student, but we think it is well to supply it.
The text ends abruptly here, probably owing to the fact 
that the scribe did not write any more This is, as a 
matter of fact, a pure conjecture, put forward by 
commentators of inferior talents, of whom the chief are 
Bentley, Hobnob and Theobald-(Contributed.)
Climate and Diet.
     FROM Ona MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT
We are undoubtedly more ruled by custom in the question 
of diet than in any other part of our daily life. Food fads 
and fancies appear from time to time in the daily Press, 
but on the whole we are probably right in believing that it 
is "The Roast Beef of Old England, that makes us what 
we are to-day." Other countries all over the world have 
their characteristic articles of diet such as the omelettes of 
France, macaroni of Italy, "Wiener Schnitzel" and 
caraway seeds of Austria, and the raw meat sausage of 
Germany. What it is that attracts attention abroad is the 
fact that diet sometimes varies according to the time of 
year. In the south of Europe one can eat in summer cold 
consomme, cold fish and cold coffee when the 
temperature is above 90 deg. in the shade; but not so in 
this country. The writer well remembers travelling down 
to Bath on a broiling July day and watching fellow 
travellers solemnly going through a menu which 
beginning with hot tomato soup (out of a packet) passed 
on to fried fish, roast beef and cabinet pudding! Heroes 
who will eat that menu in a heat wave are not going to 
flinch at the perils of India or Malaya, and one can but 
admire the audacity of the individual who consumes curry 
and rice in large quantities under such conditions.
The opposite tribulation may await the winter visitor to an 
English home, when owing to the rigours of Sunday a cold 
supper is served on the Sabbath though the thermometer 
may be below zero ; even a cup of hot soup is not allowed 
in some spartan households. While it is surmised that 
people in these islands suffer from excess of starch, as 
witness the innumerable cake shops, the jams and floury 
puddings which form such a large part of their daily diet, at 
the same time they probably consume too little fat either in 
the shape of butter, olive oil or cod liver oil. As for salads 
and fruit, it was until recently almost impossible to get 
these at any but a "crank" restaurant.
Children are certainly entitled to be fed as wisely and as 
simply as their parents' purses will allow, but the writer 
remembers trying to draw up a model diet sheet for 
children under the age of five in company with many 
distinguished dietitians: after several meetings no 
conclusions were definitely arrived at other than the 
statements quoted above. One would hesitate to be 
dogmatic, but merely to put in a plea for the broad 
principles that cold food is indicated in hot weather rather 
than hot meat and suet puddings: that ""appetite is the best 
sauce" and one that cannot be produced by chiding, prayers 
or threats: that one should feed as nature indicates, so that 
we should not force a child who dislikes eggs to take them, 
especially if on being forced it vomits or "comes put in 
spots." This automatic revolt of nature is described 
academically as "protein sensitisation," such as one gets in 
the bay fever patient or in the folk who similarly respond to 
eating shell-fish or strawberries.
   Much has been done in the past to impress upon young 
minds the need and the desirability of consuming large 
quantities of milk puddings. The dish, though tasteful to 
some, arouses in others feelings of nausea and depression. 
The fact that it is stated to be "good for you" may of course 
prejudice the individual against this nourishing diet. There 
is a natural craving, after about the first year of life, for 
hard food which demands mastication, and not for soft "pap 
" that is so often sent up for nursery meals. We hope, one 
day, to see the return to gnawing of bones by the younger 
members of the community, which shall prevent 
subsequent decay of the teeth.
   Parents will say that this is all a counsel of perfection, 
because if certain rules of diet are not enforced children 
will lose weight and suffer in their health. What, however, 
is far more likely to happen will be the submission of the 
long suffering parent, who is alternately accused of starving 
the child by prohibiting one kind of food or forcing him to 
eat another. It is interesting to notice the fact that some 
children who are faddy at home take to the plain if 
monotonous diet of a boarding school. The absence of 
attention and worry frequently account for this change It is 
a wise plan to allow a meal to be missed where there is 1.10 
inclination to eat. It is desirable during the summer months 
to banish from the breakfast table the well-worn sausage 
and bacon, replacing these dishes by either cereal such as 
grape nuts or rolled oats, and by an egg dish in some form. 
There should always be for lunch or dinner a green salad 
(which has previously been well washed), and meat in the 
summer can be banished altogether from the dietary, or at 
most taken three or four times a week. It can be replaced by 
cheese, fish, egg or chicken, or by some form of " pasta" 
such as risotto or macaroni Children suffer undoubtedly 
much more from thirst, real thirst, then do their parents, 
and no possible harm can result from allowing them to 
drink as much



THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, SEPTEMBER 1, 1927.

water or lemonade between meals as they desire. Tbe 
practice of taking very hot tea in order to cool one's tbnst 
is of doubtful benefit. The few days in England when the 
weather is really warm usually find us unprepared both as 
regards diet and costume; the Irish stew ordered yesterday 
has to be eaten under conditions that may demand cold 
salads.
Perils await us at every street corner, and in the daily diet 
we are not exempt. The milk may contain tubercle germs 
straight from tbe cow, or transmit the cause of typhoid 
from a " carrier " (the innocent harbourer of this and other 
diseases). Meat is not often found to contain parasites 
when cooked, but it is a possible danger, and raw salads 
may harbour the eggs of various animal parasites. Even 
porridge and flour contain maggots if not carefully 
examined. Much food eaten at the present time conies out 
of tins, and may have harmless colouring matter or some 
not so innocuous preservative such as benzoic acid. Recent 
legislation has limited tbe kind and amount of preservative 
allowed.
The housewife can overcome some of these perils by a 
knowledge of what constitutes a balanced diet, and sbe 
should pay a daily visit to the birder, which will ensure her 
some protection from the vagaries of the cook and much 
knowledge of the curious devices of the tradespeople. 
However careful she may be in choosing her menu, she 
can never be certain that the climate may not change over 
night, and it requires a very alert mind to keep pace with 
tbe problems which arise. But on a hot day it is just as 
possible to eat meat cold, turn once or.oked vegetables 
into salads, and to see that milk bas not "turned" by the 
elementary precaution of boiling; indeed where children 
are concerned this is al wavs advisable, or as an American 
author has well expressed it:-
        Boil your milk bottlw, or. by num.
        You'd bettar take your tickets to Kingdom coiue.
By the Way.
The cinema is the favourite art of the discontented. In its 
habitual audience you will find more damaged human 
goods than anywhere else. Here are those who think the 
world owes them a living, those whose family life is 
unhappy, and those who are afflicted with the artistic 
tempeiament without its only compensation-tbe power to 
create. Heie are women crossed in love and men crossed in 
their careers. It is an audience composed largely of those 
who want to forget.
    * "
I want to know why I receive a letter from a money-lender 
every day that. I am in London. I h>ive never been in 
bankruptcy, my speculations are philosophical, and my 
debts being t<> tailors and trouser-pressers are not 
pressing. I have never borrowed from a professional 
financier, and yet the money-lenders tbiuk it is worth 
while to spend a pound's worth of stamps every year and 
to receive no acknowledgment in return. As the only 
condition ever hinted is that no business can be transacted 
with minors or students at college, 1 am having a few 
cards printed to send in return at least. They will hear the 
inscription : " Sir, you are too generous, hut I am still a 
child in finance, a minor in money, and a student at the 
college of life." But I ask is this unsolicited 
correspondence a sign that the money-lending profession 
is in desperate or overflowing conditions?
Football Match.
   A friendly association football match took place on the 12th 
August, 1927, on the Parade ground between St. Joseph's 
School and the Police Force. The St. Joseph's School team 
consisted chiefly of boys and old boys of the school, including 
Cheok Wah, who is one of the players in the first division of the 
Straits Chinese Football Association, and the Rev Father 
Quadekker.
   The match which was very interesting and keenly followed, 
ended in a win for the Police team by 2 goals to nil One goal was 
scored from a penalty kick which was allowed for unintentionally 
handling the ball by a back in the penalty area. The Police 
fielded a very strong team and the standard of their play would 
indicate that many of them were of the team who won the "Black 
and White" trophy some months ago. - (Contributed.)

   General. - A great many Dyaks are applying for 
Government land at the Bran for planting padi this year.
   I regret to report the sudden death of Aug Goon, the 
Capitan China, on the 10th, from heart failure. He was the 
eldest Chinese trader here and bad witnessed four times 
the Betong Bazaar destroyed by fire.
   Agriculture. -There were 58 permits to plant para 
rubber issued during the month. Harvesting was over early 
this month, and the padi reports good on the whole in the 
Baku district, but failure was experienced by those who 
farmed on the banks of the main river. In many cases the 
whole field has been completely destroyed by worms.

June, 1927.
   Saratok. - Towkay Ah Pong's factory commenced 
Work on the gutta rian leaves and rubber scrap but 
they were only working during the day. He was 
also gutting his electric wiring fixed up in the bazaar 
and road and this will be continued eventually to 
the fort. Only seven shops up to the present have 
been titled for electric light
   In the evening of the 23rd a squall sprang up 
while the tide was making at Kabong and several 
boats were caught. One trading boat belonging to 
a Foochow coming from Sibu with trading goods 
was wrecked and some of his property lost and des- 
troyed but he was lucky in having a considerable 
amount recovered.
   Another boat in which were five Malays was also 
wrecked. Three of the people from this boat, a man, 
his wife and a youth, were found in an exhausted 
condition on the sands, but I regret that the re- 
mainder an old woman and a child were drowned. 
The body of the woman was recovered later on the 
sands but that of the child was never found although 
the kampong people made a three days search. I 
am told that this is the first occasion that death has 
resulted through a vessel being wrecked while 
entering or clearing from Kabong.
   The people concerned were from an up river 
kampong although the man is from Kabong.
   Early in the mouth a Dyak woman at Rohan was 
dragged out of a boat by a crocodile and killed. 
The body was, however, recovered the same evening 
by diving.

MUKAH AND BALINGIAN.
June, 1927.
Public Works. - Good progress has been made on 
the new wireless building winch should be com- 
pleted in a fortnight's time.
The local P.W.D. has finished two houses, to be 
occupied by clerks, and a third is in course of con- 
struction.
Travelling.-On the 6th I left Mukah in a hired 
motor boat Helen for Balingian I found the station 
grounds looking very tidy and the paths well kept 
and all this reflects to the credit of the Court Writer 
Ansin, who has obviously been taking a personal 
interest in these matters.
There was a very large accumulation of work to 
be dealt with and some fifty-seven cases were settled.
There are over one hundred Foochows now settled 
at Sebauh and others are coming in. The demarcator 
has finished his work for the time being and returns 
to Kuching.
The re-making of the kampong roads at Bintulu 
has been taken in hand and good progress made.
A meeting with all the principal Chinese was held 
to discuss the collection of the water rate. It was 
arranged to collect the first half-year's fees on 1st 
July and after that to collect monthly.
All the Tua-Tua Kampong were also called up and 
instructed to collect in this year's water rate within 
three months' time.
Mr. Allman has brought two instructors here to 
teach the rubber growers how to prepare their rubber 
and best methods of curing. He was still here, in- 
specting rubber gardens, etc., at the end of the 
month.

P.W.D.-The land between the signal flagstaff and the 
bungalow was tebassed by the kampong people, so that a 
clear view of the sea can now be obtained from the 
bungalow. The telephone rentis between Oya and Dalat 
was cleared.
During the month a large number of Dyaks were down 
paying in tax. Both Penghulus Umpeng and Medan 
brought up various cases for settlement.

   Mijnheer Viehoff, Labour Inspector for the Netherland 
Indies, visited Sarawak during the month and in 
connection with certain complaints made to him by the 
Javanese on the Dahan Rubber Estate, an enquiry was held 
on this Estate to look into the matter. After the result of 
the inquiry, Mijnheer Viehoff made suggestions which the 
Estate have carried out. At the beginning of the month I 
was away at Sadong.
A visit was made to the Bugis concession at Sungei 
Pendam. Al first sight a very small proportion of the area 
granted to them appears to have been opened up but what 
work has been done gave me the impression that a 
legitimate attempt was being made to work. One area 
granted to M r. Percy Hughes has not been touched end 
the Acting District Officer has been told to get into 
communication with him. A few Bugis have started 
opening up outside the area boundaries and this is 
receiving attention. As the area is situated behind Malay 
padi lands, it will be interesting to see what effect the 
Bugis drainage system has on tin se lauds. In several spots 
I noticed that the land was drying up and the Malays 
reported that it was no more suitable for padi planting.
   In the Sampun area it was decided that no further 
permits for land should be given for the present until the 
proposed continuation of the drain from Sungei Moyan is 
completed. An order was made that no further planting of 
rubber by Malays or Chinese would be permitted above 
Ampungan.
   The Dyaks in the Ulu Sadong have not yet got the 
craze for rubber planting and there is plenty of land for 
this purpose in the lower reaches of the Sadong.
   It was decided to attempt to demarcate ares for rubber 
planting and in connection with this Abang Spuan of the 
Land Office has been sent to Sadong.
   I am glad to report that the Acting District Officer, Mr. 
E. O. Bruce, whilst on a trip to Tabekang was able to 
affect the capture of ex-O. K. Layu of Temong who had 
escaped from Sadong gaol two years ago. He was ordered 
to serve his sentence in the Kuching gaol.
   Mr. R. E. Le Sueur visited Batu Kawa on several 
occasions in connection with the new bazaar. Work on this 
is proceeding very slowly.
   A number of Javanese applied fur land at the 11th mile 
to settle down on. This has been granted to them with the 
proviso that only foodstuffs are grown on the land. Very 
hot weather was experienced during the month but though 
Kuching was visited by some very heavy storms there has 
been very little rain on Matang. I am told that the last two 
months have been the driest on this mountain for the last 
16 years. In consequence of this, the water supply to the 
town has been affected, the water being turned off at 
certain hours.
   I was away from the 23rd to the 29th on special duty to 
Miri.
LAND OFFICE.
   The Chief Land Officer, Mr. C. R. Griffiths, reports: 
-
   Drainage Scheme at Sungei Moyan, Samarahan. - 
Three contracts have been let in respect of this work. The 
first of these is for a 7-foot drain between the ulu Sungei 
Moyan and the ulu Sungei Nonok. None of this work had 
been accepted at the end of the month.



230
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, SEPTEMBER 1, 1927.
   The second contract. is for 3 1/2 miles of 15-foot drain 
from T. Sabang, in the Samarahan, due east. 3,300 feet of 
this drain bad been accepted and paid for by the end of 
the month. The third contract is for miles of 15-foot drain 
east and west of the ulu Sungei Moyan. Roughly two 
miles of rentis had been cut to the west of lite starting 
point, but no drain had been cut. This was due to the fact 
that it was found that the level of the water in the Sungei 
Moyan was too high to allow a commencement of work 
on the drain. The same contractor is therefore clearing the 
Moyan of its obstructions in order to allow the water an 
easier run-off. Should this not suffice, it may be necessary 
to straighten some of the sharper bends in the river.
   Mr. Miller-Hallett is in charge of all the above work.
   Lundu Road. -The first 2 1/3 miles of this work is 
complete, except for the bridges, which are now in the 
hands of the Public Works Department.
   A contract has been let for the construction of the earth 
work for the next four miles of the road. 1 1/2 miles of this 
is reported completed. A further 2 1/2 miles is cleared and 
ready for the construction of the earthwork, while for the 
next miles the undergrowth is cleared, but felling had not 
been completed.
   A contract was prepared for this last piece of work, but 
the contractor changed his mind at the last minute, and no 
other has been found so far who is willing to undertake 
the work. Mr. Davidson is in charge of the above work.
   Several people were prosecuted during the month for 
plaining without permits and fines were inflicted by the 
Court. There is room for improvement in the office 
routine, and steps are being taken in that direction.
   The Land Inspectors were fully occupied during the 
month.
The following leases, squatter licenses and occupation 
tickets were issued during the month: -
A.  R. P.
3 Lenses for rubber and coconut               32 03 20 
12 Squatter licenses for coconut,
     sago and rubber ...	27 01 24
83 Occupation tickets for coconut,
     sago and rubber ...	... 1,052 00 17
   The total rainfall amounted to 6.40 inches.
   There were a number of visitors up from Kuching 
during the month particularly on the 23rd., when some 
twenty-three Europeans assembled to witness the football 
match, between Kuching and Upper Sarawak.
Lundu.
July, 1927.
   On the 13th, in accompany with His Highness the Tuan 
Muda, I left for Lundu in H.H.M.Y. Maimuna. On arrival 
there was a large gathering to welcome His Highness.
   There was a vast number of Court cases awaiting but 
none of these were of any special importance. Members of 
Kampongs Sempadi and Rambungan asked for one Haji 
Brahim to be appointed as their Tua Kampong vice Togok 
resigned. This matter has been referred to under separate 
cover. The whole district appeared very prosperous and the 
station very well looked after by Chia Kui Chai, the Court 
Writer in charge.
   Simatan and Telok Serabang were visited on the 17th. 
The remainder of the cattle herd was finally divided up and 
arrangements made to ship ten head to Lundu where a 
compound has already been prepared for them, and some 
seven bead were sold locally. Pepper at Simatan is as yet 
unaffected by disease and in consequence of the high price 
the neighborhood is in a very flourishing state.
   Complaints were lodged that the mandors of the Lupar 
Timber Concession were forbidding any one to work 
timber between the ulu Sempadi and Tanjong Datu, stating 
that the concession had the exclusive rights. The matter 
has been reported separately.
   The ss. Dux from Hong Kong was at anchor in Telok 
Serabang, loading timber which had been lying on the 
beach for several years, and some of this was said to be in 
a very poor condition.
   After visiting the Talang islands, where large quantity 
of turtle eggs are daily being collected, we returned to 
Kuching on the 19th.
Upper Sarawak, Bau.
July, 1927.
   The District Officer, Mr. F. H. Kortright, reports: -
   Court cases were unusually numerous. A strange case 
of attempted murder by shooting at Sungei Kandis was 
inquired into which later developed into a charge of 
practicing witchcraft being brought aganst one Ngujoh by 
the whole of the Sungei Kandis village. For his own 
personal safety and the solace of the village, Ngujoh was 
advised to leave the district and not return.
   On hearing that the Netherlands Indies Labour 
Inspector, Mijnheer Viehoff, accompanied by Mr. 
MacBryan, had left Kuching for their visit of inspection of 
the Dalian Estate, I got into touch with them at Sungei 
Tengah and arranged to meet the party on arrival at the 
Estate that evening, again the following day I fetched M. 
Viehoff from the Estate to Bau and thence back to 
Siniawan where be joined a launch for Kuching.
   Rubber planting remains active there bring ninety- 
seven occupation tickets issued for this whilst only eleven 
were issued for pepper.
   The month was very dry and hot until the 24th when a 
terrific storm brought rain but at the same time did a lot of 
damage to house roofs, telephone and light mains.
Sadong.
July, 1927.
   The Acting District Officer, Mr. E. O. Bruce, reports: 
-
   Court. - Cases were fairly numerous, sentences 
imposed included: - Bong Ng one year R.I. for assault, 
and in the Resident's Court, Layu three years R.I. 
completion of sentence after escape from jail, etc., Takor 
and Mat for intimidation, six months and three months 
respectively; Jong Jin Chong five years for assault with a 
dangerous weapon. A reported case of incest in the house 
of Penghulu Buda was inquired into and is still sub judice. 
Other cases call for no comment.
   P.W.D.-Prisoners.-The number of prisoners in the 
gang averaged eighteen, and have been employed with the 
whitewashing of Government buildings, weeding, and 
general upkeep of the station compound. The consignment 
of lime received, appears to be of poor quality. Mowers 
and coolies have been employed as usual on roads and 
kampong ditches.
   A carpenter has been employed preparing timber for 
genets repairs to out buildings, and election of latrines at 
police barracks and elsewhere.
   The jail bath house was demolished and a new one 
erected with corrugated iron walls.

given a 300-acre plot adjoining the main concession, while 
several neighboring plots now being brought under 
cultivation were still being surveyed by Abang Spuan at 
the end of the month.
   I also visited and demarcated an area about 600 acres 
between Sungei Semarah and Sungei Spayo, granted to 
certain Chinese for coconut and rubber estates-- Boundary 
rentises are now being cleared to facilitate survey by 
Abang Spuan in the immediate future. A suitable area of 
about 100 acres was demarcated for Datu Haji Halil, who 
intends to plant rubber therein. I spent some time 
inspecting the outskirts of the Tanjong opposite the 
Government Station with a view to making a rubber 
garden reserve for Chinese and others. AT no very distant 
date this will become a large island owing to the 
configuration of the main river.
   Education. - With nominal total of forty-eight pupils, 
the average daily attendance at the Government Lay 
School was only fourteen per diem. Measures have now 
been adopted to try and improve this.

suddenly made an appearance in the district, some being 
received from Dyaks in payment of tax, this was duly 
transferred to Kuching under advice, and warning given 
that it is not acceptable as legal tender. The Datu Imam, 
Haji Halil, arrived on the 15th on leave, with a view to 
opening up a rubber garden.
A successful regatta took place on the 21st and 22nd when 
an unexpectedly large crowd of natives turned up from

ward in order to lay down a boundary between 
the Layer and Rejang Dyaks. The boundary 
between the Divisions is the watershed but for 
some years the land has not been used by Rejang
Dyaks so has been farmed from this Division.
On the 9th instant I made a tour of the Division, 
returning again on the 16th. Lingga, Sebuyow, 
Kabong, Saratok Nyabor, Pusa and Betong were 
visited. In the Kalaka District there were two 
cases adjourned for Resident's Court. The Assist- 
ant District Officer was ordered to rehear them 
and obtain further witnesses before referring them 
here for a decision.
Saratok.-Some Chinese complained about being 
ordered to pull down several shops to enable a 
road to be made through middle of present bazaar 
to the back road on which many applications
                                                                                    Datu Abang Haji Buassan was seriously ill and

built on thus making one long row and, as far as
can be ascertained, without any permission. When 
His Highness the Rajah last visited this station 
three shops were ordered to be pulled down and 
these others that had been built without per- 
mission were to pay a certain sum as assessed by 
the Court the amount to go as compensation and a 
free site on present site at back allotted for new 
shops. The Assistant District Officer was ordered 
to make an inquiry, he being present at the time 
with Resident Mr. Page-Turner and to inform the 
owners amount of compensation they would 
receive, as they seemed under the impression they 
had to pull down and rebuild at own expense.
 Betong.-Chinese who had their shops, thirty- 
eight in all, destroyed by fire agreed to the proposal 
of meeting of Board of Trade and the new 
bazaar to be built on site surveyed by the Superin 
tendent of Survey Department The Chinese 
have all signed to this and the papers have been 
sent to Chief Secretary for sanction to be obtained 
for commencement of that work by P.W D. 
Mr. Edwards of this department was present at

Entulang Dyaks to settle any outstanding cases 
and to return overland. They were still away at 
end of month.
Mr. Arundell visited Betong for one night in 
order to measure out a site on Bukit Lempaong 
for a European bungalow, the present site being 
to close to proposed new bazaar site.
Mr. Arundell visited Sabu with reference to a 
complaint made by Tatam and Ajong to His 
Highness the Tuan Muda with reference to a boun- 
dary between their house and the Rev. W. Howell. 
Usu, the head of the house, did not know of any 
dispute between them.
Jabu, Tuai Rumah of Tebarong Skrang, was
allowed to make a house in a fruit grove 
but must inform Jamit who looks after fruit
 belonging to Tawan who moved to Haram many 
 years ago. There is no other suitable site.
Many Dyak returned from Miri where they had been working 
for Messrs. Sarawak Oilfields, Ltd., who are urgently 
requiring more recruits but was up to end of month 
unsuccessful in obtaining any. There seem to be no Dyaks 
left in the Ulu Ai at
present, most of them having gone out of the 
district looking for work. They have a great 
dislike to going to Miri, complaining pay insuffi- 
cient and if they do not do sufficient work get 
imprisoned. Most of them prefer to go to the 
Saribas tapping rubber and can earn $1.50 to $2 
per day for only half day's work.
Abang Sedik, Native Officer, Lubok Antu, 
arrived at end of month and reports all quiet in

Kalaka.
July, 1927.
   Mr. H. E. Cutfield, Assistant District Officer, reports:-
   Court. - During the month there were few cases that call 
for special mention. In the Resident's Court a case in which a 
Chinaman was taking a wife to China without the consent of 
her adopted father was settled. Also Haji Udon fined $50 
under section 165, l.P.C.
   In the District Court a case against Chua Ta Poh for giving 
his daughter in marriage before she was of age, which was 
referred to the Resident's Court was reheard with the object 
of getting some direct evidence as to the date of the girl's 
birth. There was no such evidence and it was considered that 
there was insufficient evidence that the girl was knowingly 
given in marriage before of a marriageable age. As the girl 
refuses to live with her husband she is ordered to refund the 
customary Chinese brian. Abang Umar was fined $25 for 
planting rubber on Engkabang's farming land and the latter 
was also fined $15 over a case of land dispute that had been 
adjourned for some time. Three Chinese were fined $ 15 each 
and one $10 for fighting in the Debak bazaar in the middle of 
the night. Chua Ma Theng, of Kaba, was fined $25 for breach 
of Arrack Regulations.
   One Malay was fined $10 for planting rubber on good padi 
land without permit. One Dyak was fined $10 for evading 
rubber registration tax. Dullah and Iut (f.) were fined two 
piculs and one picul respectively for incest, the woman's fine 
reverting to plasi menoa.
   An average number of land cases and civil claims were 
also dealt with.
   General- On Saturday 10th, the Acting Resident, Mr. C. D. 
Adams, arrived unexpectedly in m.l. One. A wireless 
message informing me of his arrival had been sent via 
Saratok but had not then arrived.
   The following day I accompanied the Acting Resident to 
Saratok, returning here on Monday afternoon.
   The next morning we proceeded in m.l. One to Nyabor to 
keep an appointment I had made some while ago with the 
District Officer, Lower Rejang, to meet about the settlement 
of the boundary question between the Second and Third 
Divisions.
   Mr. Swayne, the District Officer, Rejang, arrived at Nyabor 
in the m.I. Helen soon after us and the boundary question 
was discussed.
   Also present from the Second Division were Abang 
Bujang, Abang Abu Talip and Abang Abu Bakar, Native 
Officers, also P. Chaong. Ex-P. Sumpieng and a 
representative gathering of Dyaks and Malays from Nyabor 
and Ulu Roban.
   After certain matters were dealt with we proceeded to 
Pusa the same afternoon. The next morning the Chinese 
owners of the leaf attap bazaar on the river bank were 
approached with regard to erecting a permanent bazaar in 
place of leaf attap buildings.
   The next day they came up and said they wished to build 
a timber bazaar and asked for the shop sites to be measured 
out. This was duly done and sites for six shops marked out 
on the other side of the small stream from the main bazaar, 
but on the same side of the road and in line with the main 
bazaar. The Acting Resident, accompanied by Datu Abang 
Haji Dulrasit, who had joined him at Kabong, left for Betong 
at midday on Thursday 14th.
   I left for Debak at midday on the 15th, and reached Debak 
the same evening.
   On Sunday 17th I left by the overland route for Saratok.
   A number of matters were dealt with here and on the 
Wednesday 20th I left overland for Roban.
   Abang Bujang, Native Officer, and Court Writer Tan Eng 
Chong were waiting my arrival there, having arrived the day 
before.
   On the 22nd I left overland for the Ulu Seblak, spending 
the night at P. Chaong's house and visiting a lad who had 
been seriously wounded with a spear.
   The next night was spent at P. Engkamat's house, on the 
return journey, from where the return to the fort was made by 
boat.
The river was very low.
   The 25th was spent in Court at Roban and I returned with 
Abang Bujang and Tan Eng Chong to Kabong by 
Government boat on the 26th. While in the Ulu Seblak the 
vote was taken as to who should be made Penghulu in place 
of Penghulu Chaong. His son Entri was chosen and their 
decision has been referred to the Resident for sanction.
   Bujang menantu Sait was engaged as policeman in the 
vacancy caused by the dismissal of Corporal Anum. Dullah 
was engaged as mandor in place of Sait who was forwarded 
to Rejang for absconding from the Island Trading Company.
   Lance-Corporal Janting was promoted to corporal as 
from the 1st of the month by the order of the Acting 
Resident.
   P.W.D. The contractor having finished the ceiling of the 
officer's quarters at Saratok the prison gang were employed 
on the painting of this and also continuing their work on the 
felling of Haji Bujang's garden and the levelling and clearing 
of same in making a Government compound.
M.r Swayne also brought with him Abang Haji Bahak, 
Native Officer, Rejang, and Sol, Tua Kampong. We returned 
to the mouth that evening and proceeded to Kabong the 
next morning.
The prisoners, altogether averaging 19.15, were also 
employed on general upkeep of the station at Saratok and 
the mowing of roads as usual at Kabong.

July, 1927.
Sibu.
    Court.-In the Resident's Court an employee of 
the Monopolies Department was sentenced to three 
years' R.I. under I.P.C. section 408, while a Chinese 
was imprisoned for eighteen months under section 
116.
    A claim for $1,500 by a Foochow woman due on 
a deal in pigs was settled by agreement after an 
adjournment for discussion.
    General.-I was at Rejang up to the 4th inst. 
when I returned to Sibu by s.l. Chamois, overtaking 
the Sri Sadong on the way up and transferring 
twelve bags of mail to the launch. On the 8th Mr. 
Woodward left for Kanowit to visit the upper 
Entabai. and meet a Native Officer and Penghulu 
from the Second Division with a view to settling a 
long outstanding dispute. Mr. Woodward reported
that a settlement was arrived at without difficulty 
on lines agreeable to both Second and Third 
Division Dyaks. The terms of this agreement will 
be in force when approved by the Resident of the 
Second Division.
        In consequence of the ill-feeling between the 
Sarikei Malays and the Bugis working near the 
kampong, which culminated in an assault case a short 
time ago, I requested Datu Haji Azahari to proceed 
to Sarikei and see what he could do. The Datu 
reported on his return that he had assembled all the 
Malays and Bugis in the Mosque and had received 
a solemn assurance from all, that the trouble would
cease and that they would in future behave amicably. 
On the 19th I left for Kanowit meeting Mr.
Woodward on his return from the Entabai on the 
following day. A number of Dyaks from the 
Machan arrived at Kanowit while I was there and 
announced their intention of moving to the " Pala 
Wong". Inquiries elicited the statement that 
these people had been encouraged to this move by 
Untol of Poi, a notorious mischief maker. Untol 
was detained at Kanowit and later taken down to 
Sibu, while the Machan Dyaks were ordered to 
return to their houses in that stream.
    Accompanied by the Divisional Medical Officer I 
went on to Kapit on the 2nd. There were a few 
matters to be attended to, the Acting District Officer 
having been absent up river since the end of June. 
A gross case of cruelty to a small Chinese girl came 
before the Court. The child was removed from the 
custody of the woman responsible for the cruel 
treatment and placed in the Roman Catholic 
Convent at Sibu pending the result of inquiries in
Singapore.
    A Dyak incest case about which there appeared 
to be a good deal of excitement was dismissed, 
there being no evidence of even a remote relation- 
ship between the accused parties. A few petty 
cases were dealt with.A good deal of time was 
as usual taken up listening to Dyaks, the majority 
of whom were happily busy on their padi farms, 
the felling season being in full swing.
    The Divisional Medical Officer inoculated all 
Rangers, Police and prisoners while at Kapit.
    I left Kapit for Sibu at 3 p.m. and arrived at 3 
a.m. the following morning (the 25th) having been 
compelled by a violent storm to anchor for two 
hours.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, SEPTEMBER 1, 1927.
   Mr. E. Banks, Curator of the Sarawak Museum, 
arrived from Kuching on the 26th and left for Kapit the 
following day. He and the Divisional Medical Officer 
left at once for Belaga.
   The Sibu contingent of pilgrims, less four who had 
died on the pilgrimage, arrived by s.s. Rajah of Sarawak 
on the evening of the 26th. The party called on me in the 
course of the next few days and reported greatly 
improved conditions at Mecca. They were most 
appreciative of the assistance rendered them by the 
Sarawak Consul at Jeddah. The deaths which occurred at 
Mecca were apparently from sunstroke.
   I regret to say that yet another difficulty cropped up 
during the demarcation of the Rejang Plantation 
Company's Concession near the Bawan stream, and it 
was again found necessary to amend the boundary in 
favour of the Bawan Dyaks.
   The proposal made by the Foochow Chinese to open 
up a large acreage of sago down the Igan river is still 
hanging fire, and it is consequently too late to procure 
Dyaks to fell there this year. Unless the Chinese can be 
persuaded to do something early next year I suggest that 
the Government gives them a lead opening up and 
planting a few hundred acres. After they have gained 
some idea of the expenditure required they may possibly 
follow suit, but at present they are rather nervous of the 
experiment.
The District Officer, Sibu, reports: -
   General. - I paid a short visit to Binatang and 
Sarikei from 8th to 10th and assisted the Divisional Land 
Officer to auction 40 shop lots at the latter place. The 
average price realised was $350 per lot the greater 
number being bought by Foochows contrary to their 
expectations.
   Haji Karrim was appointed Tua Kampong of Sarikei 
in addition to his duties as Native Officer.
   Owing to numerous thefts being reported the police 
were ordered to patrol the bazaar until daybreak.
   Court Peon Samat was found with over 50 writs in his 
possession none of which he had made any effort to 
serve although the defendants were well known to him. 
He was dismissed without the customary notice, and the 
other summons servers were warned.
   Penghulu Laja was severely cautioned for his 
slackness in settling minor disputes, and was ordered to 
pay in monies which may be said to have been 
misappropriated by him.
   Arrangements were made with the Rubber 
Improvements Department to erect smoke houses, in 
Kampong Nyabor. Certain agitators attempted to resist 
this but I do not anticipate any difficulty in overcoming 
their opposition.
   Sub-Inspector Abang Adeng went to Sarikei to 
inquire into alleged thefts from Chinese by Dyaks but no 
evidence was obtained to corroborate the statements.
   Clerical Staff. - J. Kok was appointed Court Writer 
at Binatang vice Charles Law who was transferred to 
Rejang.
   Education. -Two Foochow school-masters were 
dismissed for faking the attendance returns and the 
grants for their schools withheld for 2 months at the 
request of the Foochow Committee. The R.C. Mission 
grant was raised from $1 to $1.50 per capita.
   Telegraph & Telephones. -A launch was chartered 
to send the mechanic to repair the Matu plant.
   Prisons. -Nine men were imprisoned and seven- 
were discharged. Thirty-six remained at the end of the 
month. The conduct of the prisoners showed marked 
improvement.
   Police. -Two recruits joined, one was invalided out 
of the force and one dismissed. Five men were sent to 
Rejang on the 2nd to replace the local force who were 
to be sent here for training but up to the time of writing 
the Rejang Police have not arrived. This leaves the 
headquarters force inconveniently short of men. Five 
constables qualified for reading and writing allowance. 
Six defaulters were dealt with.
   Police Court - Ting Hiang was fined $10 for 
contempt of Court; Lim Ah Tiew, Kui Ewe Hin, Ngui 
Kee Soon, Chua Ah Biong, Yong Ah Chap $20 each 
and Kee Ah Poh $5 for committing affray; Lee See Tay 
and Ling Chee Chang $26 each under Opium Order.
   The following were sentenced to terms of 
imprisonment: -Wong Ah Ming one week under 
section 379; LAU Koh Kum one mouth for picking 
pockets; Wong Hie Ming three years under section 408 
and Tan Ting Soh eighteen months under section 109.
   District Court. -Lau Tong Kee and Wee In In were 
fined $15 each and Haji Ani for assault; Chai See $25 
under section 285; Si Ing Sung $25 for elopment 
Encharang one pikul for setting pig trap and Wong 
Hieng Chiong $19 for trespass.
   Tepol was sentenced to three months' imprisonment 
for non-payment of Native Court fine and two weeks 
for contempt of Court.
   Immigrants-One hundred and seventy-three male, 
seventy-four female and eighty-four children arrived 
during the month.
   Fines and fees amounted to $1,490.64 during the 
month.
Lower Rejang.
July, 1927.
   The District Officer, Lower Rejang, Mr. J. C. 
SWAYNE, reports: -
   Court. -The only case of importance was that of Ah 
Jit vs. Tan Piu. Plaintiff charged defendant with stealing 
his pepper and felling it to other growers. Defendant 
was sentenced to a term of imprisonment on his own 
confession, but no evidence implicating other persons 
was offered.
   General. - I was at Daro for a few days at the 
beginning of the month. The usual number of civil cases 
were heard. There is still a large number of applications 
for land on which to plant rubber, but a request for a site 
on which to open a second sawmill has not been 
proceeded with, owing to the drop in the price of 
prepared timber.
   The Resident of the Division was here for a few days 
and held an inquiry into the affairs of Gurdat Singh, 
who was imprisoned here some four years ago.
   Messrs. Mudford and Kennedy visited the station on 
Customs affairs and also inspected the Light at Selalang 
mouth. This light has now been in use for over a year, 
but has not yet been officially notified. Other visitors to 
the station were Mr. Duncan and the Rev. Father Jansen.
   The prisoners have been engaged on levelling the 
site of the wireless station and also on digging a well in 
the Government compound : this will be for the use of 
the Chinese community during exceptionally dry 
seasons. Very little rain fell during the month and there 
has been a serious shortage both in the kampong and 
bazaar.
