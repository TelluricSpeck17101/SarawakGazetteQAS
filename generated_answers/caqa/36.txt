 One of the most interesting pieces of litigation ever known in Kenosha County occurred when a suit was filed with Fred F. Higgins and Charles Higgins as plaintiffs and more than a hundred heirs of the late Fitch A. Higgins as defendants, aiming to clear the title of a farm of 230 acres in Pleasant Prairie. This lawsuit is an echo of the once famous will contest that was tried in Kenosha County courts when Fitch A. Higgins passed away in the early eighties and left behind an estate valued at close to $150,000.
