 Charles Sumner is considered as the Senator in this context from the United States. Context mentions that "Charles Sumner...is our Senator" who battled in the cause of liberty so long in the Senate of the United States." However, it should be noted that this was written in the past and Charles Sumner served as a senator during his lifetime (1811-1901). The current U.S. Senators change over time based on elections.
