 Two solutions to avoid spoiling chicken in Sarawak are: 1) Make an intelligent use of fish, eggs, and vegetables instead of relying on chicken as the daily staple dish. This ensures that you don't have to rely on chicken every day even when fresh meat is unavailable. 2) Ensure proper care while preparing fowls for eating by hanging them for at least eighteen hours before cooking and plucking them by hand, which makes a significant difference in the texture and flavor of the chicken.
