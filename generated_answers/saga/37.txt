TDMG: The first time I saw her, she was standing in the middle of a field with her arms outstretched and her face turned up to the sky. She looked so peaceful that it took me by surprise. It wasn’t until later that I learned she had been through hell and back. But there she stood, basking in the sunshine as if nothing could ever hurt her again.

I was drawn to her strength and resilience. We became friends quickly, and soon we were inseparable. She taught me how to be strong even when life seemed impossible. And I showed her that it’s okay to let someone else help you carry the load sometimes.

We shared many adventures together, but our friendship was never easy. There were times when she would shut everyone out and retreat into herself. But no matter what happened, I always knew she would come back stronger than before. And so we continued on, side by side, through all of life’s ups and downs.
