 Some challenges faced by communities living near rivers such as Simunjan and Gedong during this time period include floods that could ruin their lowland padi farms (as seen in Tebekang and Pichin), lack of fruit for consumption due to scarcity, and potential conflicts over the opening up of the river to Dayak immigrants. Additionally, there were reports of considerable damage from wild animals due to a lack of available food sources as fruit was practically non-existent that year.
