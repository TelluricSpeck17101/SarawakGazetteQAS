 Concerns raised about Sarawak Library membership fees were related to its high cost and limited accessibility due to the building's unsuitability. The suggestion made by "Casual" regarding non-members visiting the library was that visitors staying in Kuching may be admitted to the advantages of the lending Library by paying a subscription fee of $1 per month or part thereof, provided that such privilege shall not extend beyond six monthly payments (Rule 12).
