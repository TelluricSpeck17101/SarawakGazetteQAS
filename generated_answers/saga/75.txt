 In August 1948, mines in Bau District were producing gold and showing promise with new developments. The Bukit Young Mine under Ong Ah Khin was the most successful mine at that time. Ban Lee Mine's production reports always showed a Nil Return, making its status unclear. Two other mines opened by Ng Kui Hiung and Lee Tung Sen also had potential for being relatively rich in ores. Mr. Richards suggests that these mines should take measures to assist in safeguarding their own property and focus on genuine efforts to recommence operations within two years, as the Supreme Council has resolved upon certain measures like remission of rent and continuance of remission of royalty on gold won to help rehabilitate the mining industry.
