 The "Tongkol," an experimental fisheries vessel, will test fishing methods based on close observation of the habits of fish. When there is evidence of fish in the vicinity, they throw a large palm frond overboard and wait for the fish to congregate under it before one crew member enters the water to guide them into a net that has been prepared by the rest of the fishermen.
