 When he was caught with opium, a Chinese man named Sia Ah Heng was convicted of being in possession of six bundles of raw opium valued by the Customs at $5,300 and sentenced to three months' imprisonment and a fine of $400. In another case, Chai Kuet Foong, a Kheh arriving from China by the s.s. Pangkor, had been found in possession of 425 boons (a unit of opium), valued at $12,750, ingeniously hidden in umbrellas. He was sentenced to nine months and a fine of $500. In both cases the opium was confiscated and in both cases the appeals to the Resident's Court were dismissed.
