 The reason behind prohibiting tuba fishing in certain rivers is that it led to overfishing and depletion of fish stocks. Tuba fishing involved putting a root into the water that stupefies or poisons the fish, making them easier to catch with spears. This method was detrimental to the conservation and rational exploitation of fish as a food source since it caused rivers to become almost entirely devoid of large fish due to overfishing. Prohibiting tuba fishing allowed for stocking of the rivers to respond all at once, leading to an increase in fish population and making them more plentiful for local communities who relied on fishing for sustenance.
