 In Ellin Anak Masing v. The King case, there wasn't a competent court to entertain an appeal because at the time when the appeal could have been heard, Japanese forces had occupied Kuching. As a result, the appeal was brought to the attention of a Japanese police officer who sentenced the appellant to ten years in prison instead of being entertained by a proper legal entity.
