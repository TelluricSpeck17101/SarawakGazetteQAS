 The condition of Dalat road, Bakong-Trus road, and other Oya roads is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be understood that these roads are under construction or have been recently completed as part of the Public Works Department's activities. Progress on some roads like Kuching-Serian Road has been disappointing and may not be finished before June. The Bau Road reconstruction is also behind schedule and might not finish until middle of 1954. Other minor paths are adequately maintained by Local Authority, as well as bazaar roads.
