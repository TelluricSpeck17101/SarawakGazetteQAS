 In January 1932, heavy rain caused floods in Oya and Dalat, with the water at one time standing ankle deep inside the jail in Dalat. The roads were impassable, and padangs (rice fields) turned into marshes due to the soft mud several inches deep. Additionally, reports from upriver mentioned that the floods caused considerable damage to the padi crop in the lower Oya region.
