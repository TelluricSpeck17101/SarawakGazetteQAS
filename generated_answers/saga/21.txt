 In February 1930, during that month, a drought was experienced for two and half months in Bintulu. The rainfall recorded was only .99 inches which was considered unusual as it followed an exceptionally dry December. There were no significant court cases or events happening at the time. A curry dinner by members of the Bintulu Recreation Club, followed by a concert, was held for His Excellency during his visit to Bintulu. The lack of water became somewhat serious and there was no sign of anti-cession activity in any place visited.
