 The main purpose of the Kuching Annual Agricultural Show was to encourage and help small-holders working on their own land through mixed farming, as well as promoting the growth of foodstuffs. It also aimed at beautifying Kuching by encouraging people to plant flowering trees and bushes in public areas.
