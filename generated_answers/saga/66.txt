 At Sabulan, Bau, the process used to extract gold involved washing the sago dust on a mat below the rasping bench and then treading it with water. This method differs from what "old stagers" might be familiar with as they would typically use sieving and sedimentation in long troughs to separate out fine powdery refuse, followed by drying the refined starch on mats in the sun before bagging for export.
