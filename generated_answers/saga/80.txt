 In terms of transportation methods around 1912 compared to today, some differences include:
1. The presence of small motor boats that were introduced at that time and are not commonly used nowadays.
2. A regular daily train passenger service in Kuching which no longer exists.
3. The character of certain places has changed from disreputable areas with Japanese brothels to more respectable establishments like banks, offices, and dispensaries.
