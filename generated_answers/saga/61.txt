 The Food Control Department faced difficulties supplying rice during the month due to irregular supplies from Singapore, leading them to substitute raw sago for rice in some instances. To ensure rice supply, they asked the Food Control Officer of Kuching for a larger supply and purchased large quantities of sago at Daro which were shipped to Sibu and distributed as necessary. However, the native population relied heavily on government support and did not take initiative to plant their own food substitutes until their supplies dwindled.
