 Mr. Wade argues about determining facts in a native criminal case by stating that an administrative officer's "knowledge of the native" should not replace evidence in court and that a fully-trained and energetic inspectorate should be appointed to handle such cases, disregarding complaints from profiteers who claim this is an outrageous interference with their civil liberty. Financial considerations affect this issue as it involves the cost of appointing more trained officers and potentially facing objections or complaints from those exploiting public resources.
