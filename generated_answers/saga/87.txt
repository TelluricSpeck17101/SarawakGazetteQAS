Brooke's contribution to Sarawak during his stay there was reorganizing the Health Department in the spring of 1928, leaving behind a record of valuable service for which he deserves the gratitude of every man and woman in the State. His efforts in the cause of public health have been untiring, attended by a large measure of success.
