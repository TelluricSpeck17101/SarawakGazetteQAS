 In the report by District Officer, Miri, it was mentioned that there were land disputes among Dayaks which impacted cession discussions. The main issue seemed to be that Dayaks had been renting out their lands to Chinese who were willing to pay higher rents than what other Dayaks could offer. This created conflicts between different groups of Dayaks over the ownership and usage of these lands, leading to disputes and complications in land-related discussions during cession negotiations.
