 The Bisaya language has an ancient relationship with the Visayan languages spoken in Southern Philippines, and it shares similarities with certain North Borneo and Brunei Dusun tongues. However, its associations in Sarawak are not well known. The Bisaya people live mainly around Brunei Bay, Padas and Kelias river basins in North Borneo, the Tutoh River tributary of Baram in Sarawak, and Labuan island.
