 The events that led up to Charles Brooke's intervention in Sadong district include a Chinese Rebellion where his town was burnt down and he escaped by swimming across the river; a great fire in Kuching in 1884, although not as serious as the Chinese Insurrection, still caused significant damage; and two small disturbances reported from Sadong and Miri which could be adjusted through sympathetic enquiries into causes.
