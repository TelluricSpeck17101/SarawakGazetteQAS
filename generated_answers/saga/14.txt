 The purpose of establishing Central Banks and Co-operative Rural Credit movement according to the passage is to alleviate poverty and indebtedness among rural populations by operating rural credit societies based on the Raiffeisen model, which aims to prevent small farmers from falling into debt again through cooperation. This can be achieved by providing banking help to the 85% of farmers who are currently inaccessible due to their small businesses for any other banking agency except the Co-operative Rural Credit movement.
