Colorado ranchmen report that during the past winter grass has been uniformly excellent, and cattle sleek and fat.

His better feelings at times predominated, honour resumed her sway over his mind, and when Cornelia stood before him in her calm and innocent loveliness, he trembled at the base idea of inflicting pain on a being so tender and so pure, and his soul revolted at the projects he had half dared to form. The innocent cause of his embarrassment could not avoid noticing that his manner, at times, did change, though she was far from suspecting the cause.

The Indians had been living there from time immemorial, subsisting on fish (and shellfish), with which the waters abound. A vessel was sent to the island, and all the Indians were taken aboard with the exception of one woman, whose child or children had been forgotten. It is believed that a gale was coming up, and that the skipper found his little craft in danger, and so put off. Others say that the woman was purposely deserted. In any event, the boat sailed away, leaving her standing alone on the beach, and, being \"only an Indian woman,\" it probably mattered little to the other hunters, who were glad to get away from the rough coast. When the Indians were landed at Santa Barbara, it was said to be the intention of the captain to return and rescue the woman. But not long after, the sloop was wrecked and the story of the lost woman became almost a legend, her appearance often being pictured by the storytellers of the day, and her one quaint cry of \"Maneuauna\" being repeated to credulous listeners.",

While thinking over the various substances that had been or might be used with advantage, it occurred to him that muriate of ammonia, the common sal-ammoniac of the druggist, hartshorn might answer well for the purpose required, both from the nature of its base and its acid, and he determined to try the experiment of using it. He accordingly dissolved a small piece, weighing by estimate four or five grains, in about half a coffee cup of water. Into that he put a small handful of seed corn, and suffered it to remain four or five hours, and then planted it.

It is charged that the men who have been conducting the association have swindled thousands of people in every state in the union; have taken in $200,000 to $850,000, giving nothing in return. The victims are found in all classes of people. For more than six months letters have been received from all parts of the country by the post office and city authorities protesting that the company was not what it was represented to be; that it was collecting money and making no loans. Inspector Stuart has been working on the case four months. He found that the concern had agents in every state in the union, who were selling the $20,000,000 of stock the company had for sale. These agents were sent circulars and documents showing the association to be gilt-edged. When Inspector Stuart took charge of the case Lewis F. Mortimer, general manager and secretary, was apparently a responsible man and handled the cash received in large amounts every day. Stuart visited the company's office frequently disguised as a letter carrier in order to secure evidence. Several weeks ago Mortimer disappeared.",

In the cotton belt live stock farming has been avoided mainly for two reasons: (1) Because all-cotton farming paid better until the soil became poor; (2) because of the cattle tick. Now, millions of acres are too poor to grow cotton profitably, and we can easily eradicate the cattle tick. Since the work of eradicating the tick was inaugurated, nearly 200,000 square miles have been cleaned for all time; this is an area over three times as large as Alabama. The tick injures the hide, reduces the milk flow at least ten per cent, makes it very difficult to fatten cattle, prevents the introduction of good cattle to breed up our native cattle, lowers the price of our cattle on the markets and destroys more than enough cattle, every year to pay for its eradication. The days of the tick are numbered. The last tick will be destroyed in a few years, and then the south will adopt a permanent system of agriculture promising prosperity to present population and to posterity. Died at Husband's Funeral.

In all ages long past, the little republic of Padua had a dispute with the pope of Rome, who insisted upon exercising over it temporal as well as spiritual authority. The dispute growing very hot, the pope fulminated his threats against any of the citizens that should take part with the senate of Padua; and the senate too, threatened with the punishment of death any subjects of the republic, that should take side with the pope. During this dilemma, an officer of the senate asked a priest of Padua, \u2018whether he preferred being hanged for obeying the pope, or being excommunicated for obeying the senate.\u2019 To this the priest replied, \u2018that for his part, he had rather be excommunicated thirty years, than be hanged for obeying an ordinance of man.\u2019 New Goods.

Twelve hundred telegraph poles, carrying a thousand miles of wire, are down between New York and Norfolk. In New York, the sleet played havoc with trolleys and trees and completely paralyzed traffic in several of the boroughs. Brooklyn was without an adequate streetcar service for many hours, and before the repairs to the trolley wires were made, twenty-five horses were killed by electricity.

After the conquest of Poland permission would be given Russia to send a number of bolshevik commissioners into that country to control the export of Polish supplies of all kinds.

Slavery is sanctioned by the laws of the State, and the right to hold slaves under our municipal regulations is unquestionable; but we view this as a right, existing by positive law, of a municipal character, without foundation in the law of nature, or the unwritten and common law. In other words, all the Courts, Federal and State, unite in these two propositions, that slavery can only be created by positive law, State law, and establish these propositions, that neither Congress, nor the people of a territory can create the institution. If our friend doubts on this point, let him ask, how Kentucky passed the law of 1833! That forbids the bringing of slaves into the State. By what right? If Slaveholders may go where they please with their property, if they can establish slavery where it does not exist, why, then, this law is unconstitutional!

The figures are all sworn to, and no doubt understate the different amounts. They will give the reader a better idea of the returns of the soil, than mere words possibly could. The population of Los Angeles County is 30,000, two-thirds are natives, and non-producers. There are in the County 15,000 acres of land under cultivation. The nett profit all around is $128 to the acre. There are produced 1,000,000 gallons of wine, 112,000 gallons of brandy, 180,000 bushels of corn, 150,000 bushels of barley, and 13,000 bushels of wheat. The orange crop sold, was worth $527,000; walnuts, $105,000; lemons, $35,000; and other articles, such as limes, almonds, etc., brought large amounts.

It is believed that the President has missed the mark and that his interference will have an effect the opposite of which he desired. The leaders of the different factions seem as far apart as ever, and one of them gave out in an interview the opinion that \"Mr. Roosevelt has accomplished nothing except to lay bare to every side that the republicans of Maryland are sadly divided. All his advice will have no material effect upon the campaign.\" On the other hand, as is well known, Maryland people, when in politics, are exceedingly clannish. They resent outside influence, and in my judgment a mistake has been unwittingly made by President Roosevelt. Senator Gorman criticized the President's interference very severely. He said, \"The voters of the country are confronted with the almost unprecedented and most extraordinary spectacle of the President devoting practically all his time to the conduct of campaigns in the states where local elections are pending.

Hill, the Napoleon of the northwest, that ships for ocean carrying can be built at less cost in the United States than in Great Britain. This is construed into an argument against the pending ship subsidy bill, the line of reasoning being that if ships can be built more cheaply in this country than in Europe no encouragement to the upbuilding of an American merchant marine is necessary. The argument is fallacious from the fact that cost of ship is only one of the factors entering into cost of shipping. Another factor, equally important, is cost of wages paid the crew, a cost which is at least 15 per cent higher on American than on competitive ships. If this were not so and if ships could be built in the United States more cheaply than in Europe, the only explanation which would remain for the spectacle of American exporters paying out in excess of $200, 000,000 a year in ocean freights to foreign carriers instead of building cheaper ships and paying this immense sum, profit and all, into their own pockets would be that they were suffering from an inexplicable epidemic of paresis.

As far as the eye can reach in every direction are seen heaps of ruined edifices with but small portions of their walls standing. The plains are everywhere strewn with broken pottery which show red, white and lead color, and black fragments. The figures on the pottery are geometrical, formed with taste, and are similar to those found on the Salinas, 40 miles north of this place. The origin of these buildings is shrouded in mystery. When first discovered by the early explorers of the territory they were much the same as in their present condition, and the Indians then affirmed that they had been built 500 years. The whole country for hundreds of miles around shows traces of extinct civilization, and fills the mind of the traveler with the most perplexing questions: What race of people dwelt here? By whom were these decaying walls erected? Who constructed the many thousand miles of acequas?

Her husband was enjoined from coming to her house or interfering with her in the control and management of the minor children. The case, from its beginning has been one of peculiar interest, and as the facts came before the public, much sympathy was enlisted for Mrs. Cunningham. The first public notice of the matter was brought out by Mr. K. Cunningham, who was at the time a member of the police force, having one of his sons arrested. While the boy was in the custody of the arresting officers, Cunningham struck him with a walking cane. The father was arrested on a warrant worn out by the mother, and upon his trial was convicted of assault and battery and sentenced to pay a fine of $200. In this case an appeal was taken to the supreme court. In the meantime, Mrs. Cunningham had instituted proceedings for a partial divorce from her husband. While this was pending, she went before Judge Marshall J. Clarke with a petition to enjoin her husband from coming to her house to interfere with the management of the minor children.

He stopped one day at Oswego for refreshment, and arrived here last evening, having performed a most difficult service, with his usual gallantry and conduct.

And that until remedies can be devised by the wisdom of our Legislature, which shall strip the abolitionist of his present legal impunity, we will appeal to that inherent, inalienable power, which resides in every people for the purpose of self-protection. Resolved, That in the exercise of this power, never to be wielded but on the ground of strict necessity, we will not consciously pass the boundaries which, among all just and enlightened nations, limit the sacred right of defense.",

Yet, in these parts, a sack of flour, weighing only 196 pounds, costs $4, and until very recently, the price was nearer $5. At present rates, a barrel of flour would cost over $8, which is almost up to famine price in the East. Why is it, with such plentiful crops, that bread- stuffs are so enormously high out here? And why is it, with such plenty in the land, that boarding is from $7 to $8 per week higher here now than it was last Winter, when provisions were scarce, and some people really began to talk of famine? Some things, we know, are cheaper here than in the East, where boarding is $7.50 to $8 per week. Beef, for instance, is three or four cents per pound cheaper; and groceries are very little higher. Upon this principle, if the Eastern people had such plenty of everything that they had to throw it away, people out here would starve, in consequence of not being able to earn enough to keep their insides going.

Among the very few books on this subject worth reading, we notice one recently published by Rev. Dr. Crane, of Newark, with the title which forms the caption of this article.

The Doctor was for years the President of the Methodist College in Pennington, and is an author of some note on popular church topics in that denomination. The grounds taken in the work are mainly that the ideas which underlie the popular amusements are not evil, but that the manners of their general practice are inherently wrong and utterly inconsistent in church members.

The water undermined the wall, about midway of the house, on the upper side, causing some fifteen or twenty feet to fall, carrying with it some bulk tobacco of Averett & Co.

The true solution of the matter then is that mule raising is an exhausting process; and the supply has not kept pace with the demand. Through every decade, labor of all kinds has greatly increased. The production of Cotton has been doubled within twenty years; the same remark is true of Sugar and some other articles. Steam has diminished somewhat the use of the horses upon roads, but not for the plough. And, in a word, the supply has not kept pace with the demand. Upon this principle, which governs all commerce, the profits of raising horses and mules have increased. The temptation to sell brood mares has caused the stock to be lessened.

A MAN WHO HAS PAID.-- Let a man fail in business, what a wonderful effect it has on his former friends and creditors! Men who have taken him by the arm, laughed and chatted with him by the hour--shrug up the shoulder, and pass on with a chilling 'how do ye do!' Every trifle of a bill is hunted up and presented, that would not have seen daylight for months to come, but for the misfortune of the debtor. If it is paid, well and good--if not the scowl of a sheriff, perhaps, meets him at the first corner. A man who never failed, knows but little of human nature.
