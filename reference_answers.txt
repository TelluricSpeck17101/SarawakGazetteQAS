Second Division News.
December, 1931.
Extracts from the Second Divisional Reports for December. 1931, by Mr. E. O. Bruce. Acting Resident: -
I returned from a short visit to Kuching on the 5th after having discussed several matters regarding Dyak affairs.
Penghulus Ramba and Kana visited Simanggang on the 7th, returning a few days later.
During the month there have been exceptional floods, with damage to standing crops, which will undoubtedly cause a certain amount of hardship to those whose harvest was a failure last year. This matter has been the subject of a separate interim report to the Secretary for Native Affairs, meanwhile the Agricultural Field Officer, Mr. Goodall, is assisting by visiting and collecting information to confirm alleged reports of “starvation,” which will enable me to deal with bona fide cases of real hardship, where property has already been pawned to purchase foodstuffs.
There continues to be a distinct tendency in the bazaars to refuse credit. There has been a small rise in the market price of raw sago, which is at present about the daily produce which can be worked by natives with any profit, but is mostly owned by Malays.
At the request of certain penghulus, notices have been issued forbidding the usual crowds of strangers from other Districts swarming into certain Dyak areas to collect fruit, as they cannot afford to offer them free board and lodging this season as is their usual custom. They hope to raise some ready cash by trading surplus fruit in the bazaars themselves, to augment their shortage of padi.
I visited the subsidized Chinese Pepper gardens in the Skrang on the 14th, with the Agricultural Field Officer. An improvement was noticed, and the urgent necessity of further consignments of prawn refuse, etc., is being dealt with.
On the 19th I inspected the Government Lay School, which appears to be well attended.
A small representative party of Penghulus from Kalaka, Saribas and Skrang were invited to the Sibu Regatta and Aum at New Year.
They left on the 20th in the charge of the Acting Assistant District Officer, Kalaka, Mr. Morse, via Kuching.
Pengiran Azit, Native Officer, was on the sick list for a week, but has since recovered from a mild attack of dysentery.
On the 24th Messrs. Daubeny and Hansom arrived from Belong and Engkilili to spend the Christmas vacation in Simanggang.
Government Offices were closed on Christmas and Boxing Day.
I left for Betong on the 27th overland, accompanied by the District Officer, in order to attend to appeal cases, and was still away at the end of the month.
SIMANGGANG DISTRICT.
Extracts from the report of Mr. W. P. N. L. Ditmas: -
General. -Numbers of Dyaks are reporting a shortage of food, many of them having to live on sago as their staple food.
A Dyak house, R. Baroh, Langas, was reported completely destroyed by fire through the carelessness of those left in the house, whilst the majority of the inhabitants were out farming.
Lingga. -I was still at Lingga on the 1st, continuing checking accounts. Orders were given for the Government buildings to be whitewashed and tarred. The following day I left Lingga by boat at 4.30 p.m. and proceeded up river, the night was spent at a Dyak house, Simanggang being reached the next morning.
Travelling. -I was away visiting Batang Ai, Ulu Undup and Daw, via Engkilili, from 9th to the 15th.
On the 19th, the week end was spent at R. Mang, Gran, by Mr. Barcroft and myself, Mr. Barcroft’s outboard motor being used. The house is one of nearly fifty doors and there are several other long houses, all very close, the total number of doors of these houses must be well over 100.
Education. -The school attendance for the month was 89.
Medical. -A total of 402 out-patients were treated during the month. A record of 95 N.A.B. injections were performed.
Total rainfall for the month was 21.54 inches.
Court. -In the District Court, there were only four criminal cases.
In the Magistrate’s Court, there were twenty-three cases, of which eleven criminal and twelve civil, and claims amounted to $253.03.
Total fines imposed during the month were $504.22 and fees collected $47.55.
Trade and Customs.

Q: What was the reason for issuing notices prohibiting strangers from collecting fruit in certain Dyak areas?
A: The reason for issuing notices prohibiting strangers from collecting fruit in certain Dyak areas was because they could not afford to offer them free board and lodging this season as is their usual custom, and they hoped to raise some ready cash by trading surplus fruit in the bazaars themselves, to augment their shortage of padi.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, OCTOBER 3, 1907.
233
    The new seine net has been used several timer’
this is the only seine in Oya of any size now which
is in use and in consequence the Government people
have been enjoying a very fair supply of excellent
fish. Fish have been none too plentiful during the
month, the Panau hauls having been small and the
Rantau people having had but poor hauls also.
    A fine comet has been visible in the East during
the latter part of the month. It has been at it’s
best just before dawn.
    Weather.—The drought has been quite extra-
ordinary and the effect has been felt throughout the
month. The water supply for the up-river Kam-
pongs is very bad indeed, it consisting mostly of a
few muddy water holes far away in the jungle. The
people collect around these early in the morning
and the late arrivals get nothing but wet mud as
their share. Al Oya itself the want of water has
. not made itself felt to such a degree as up-river, the
wells having been deepened giving a very fair
' supply.
    The garden here has suffered considerably, all the
grass having shrivelled up to such an extent that
the mowers had to be taken off theie being nothing
to mow. The thermometer in the Bungalow at 8
A. M. has been mostly at 80	82; at 11 A. M. at
00 to 02 or 93, and the heat has been almost un-
bearable at times, latterly however tiiis has been
tempered with the strong S. \V. wind. A little rain
has fallen but not in sufficient quantity to do any
good at all. Everyone says that the lu-at has been
most exceptional.
!	Cattle.-— The herd of cattle are in excellent con-
? dition and now number 42 head. Three times
I during the month the whole herd stampeded during
the night, breaking out from the shed and destroying
the fences in their rush. They went to the Kuala
and were only induced to return after much difficulty.
What has caused this stampede is a mystery as they
have been plentifully supplied with water during the
night: probably the intense heat has had something
to do with it.
    Exports.—The export of Haw Sago during the
month amounted to 441 coyans as against 373 coyana
exported during the corresponding month of last
year.
    Health.—The health of the District has not been
good, there having been a good deal of fever and
other sickness in all the Kampongs and several
deaths have resulted.
    Of course this is due to the extraordinary heat
and failure of the water supply. However, it is to
be hoped that this drought will soon break up and
that a downpour of rain will restore the health of
the District to it‘s former condition.
DONALD A. OWEN.
Resident.
SIMANGGANG
August.
    I left Kuching for Kabong after the -Race week’
festivities on August 6th in the s. s. Alice Lorraine,
Your Highness having kindly allowed me to proceed
by her in order to visit the Kalaka and Saribaa
rivers. The steamer left Kabong early the next
morning, on the 7th, for Sibu with Messrs. Johnson,
Page-Turner, and Cutfield.
    The jungkat fishing season was in full swing at
Kabong and good hauls of Dueh, Bujang. aur-aur,
Tenggirch, and other inferior fish were invariably
made whilst 1 was there.
    The prolonged drought caused much discomfort to
the people and as the across-river so-called ‘wells’
—properly ‘water holes’ for none of them are six.

J UffUSt.
   Court.—As usual the heaviest Court work has
been at Dalat, there being but few cases either in the
Police or Debt Court at Oya. 1 was holding Court
at Dalat between the 7th and the 15th. None of the
cases from either Court call for special comment.
   Public Morits.—The Police Quarters at Dalat
have been rebuilt on the new site. This was done
?with very little expense as nearly all the timber from
the old building was good and with few exceptions
could be used in the construction of the new. Some
of the smaller wood, such as kassous and paks, had
to be renewed but these did not take very Fong to
obtain.
   The prisoners at Oya have been employed in re-
pairing the road and in transforming the Malay
Court into a residence for Hj: Taha. He will live
here till his new house is completed as the house in
which he lives at present is in a dreadfully dilapi-
dated state and may collapse at Any moment.
   A new Rest house has been built at Kuala Penat.
This was very necessary as the old one was in a bad
?state and not fit for use. The new one should be
much appreciated by Europeans going to and from
Mukah and Oya. It is built entirely of nibongsaiid
leaf attaps, and these were supplied by the people of
Judan and Penat.
   General.—A Chinese boy aged 10 was drowned at
Dalat on the 8th. He fell into the river between
the logs of a jelatong and apparently was suffocated
while jammed underneath them. The water was
18 feet deep under the jelatong and the body was
recovered there by In. Bujang A an hour after the
-accident.
   The s. s. Sarawak made three trips to Oya during
the month taking away the usual cargoes. On one

Q: What was the cause of the stampede among the cattle in Simanggang?
A: The cause for the stampede among the cattle in Simanggang is not known but it could be due to intense heat as they had plenty of water during night and there were no other reasons mentioned.

Fort was dismantled and ail drugs and fittings 
transferred to the new hospital building down the 
Green Road.	
   Agriculture.Many persons applied for permis- 
sion to plant rubber,but as there is a strong 
tendency to plant up rubber in ancestral sago 
gardens a few permits only were issued,after 
inspection of the land applied for.

labouring classes who came from various places in the south seas. They, spoke blatantly, spat everywhere at any time, and many of them were far from healthy. All these little inconveniences we endured as best we could. After all, we cannot have “our cake and eat it," as the saying goes, and if we had wanted a more comfortable trip we would have travelled first or second class and then economised in China. HONG KONG. It was with much relief when at 9.30 a.m. on the 26th Hong Kong town was seen. Half an hour later we entered the harbour and the ship east anchor. Crowds of hotel runners came on board, shouting nt the tops of their voices for clients. The crowds moved about, and we found ourselves packed like sardines. The hotel people were soon followed by a swarm of hawkers, bringing their wares for sale. These hawkers are to say the least of it annoying in the way they conduct business; they practically force the passengers to buy their goods, edible and non-edible, from needles to blanket As far as I could see none of them were licenced, for at the sound of cha shi, which means that the Inspector of Police or some other officer of the law, had arrived to inspect licences, each and every one of them hid their various goods under camp- beds and amongst the property of the passengers, and they themselves sat calmly and quietly like other passengers. Some of them undoubtedly did good business. This sudden stop dead of trade happened many times, and being curious about such a state of affairs 1 enquired from many of them the reason why they did not obtain licences before hawking. They all told me the same story; although the licences only cost $2 per month, the issue is limited, and another reason was that if they apply for a licence it will cost them a fortune, and many have lost part of their savings without obtaining a licence, hence it is better to hawk illegally. Beggars also came into the ship to try their luck; they were soon followed by some singers who came down to croon for their food. The ship discharged her cargo till late in the evening, and was full of dust and foul air. This, coupled with the noise made by children crying, mothers scolding, and the cranking of the winch, made the ship worse than the tower of Babel,— with the addition of children running about and their fathers taking no heed of them. Passengers were quarrelling with hawkers over their purchases. By 5 p.m. the hawkers left the ship, but the noise still remained the same as the various passengers who had bought the hawkers’ articles began to talk among themselves of what they had purchased, shouting from one corner of the ship to the other. This noise continued up to midnight. One was often woken up with a start by the noise of cursing or yelling, someone by accident or intention having spilt some hot tea or dropped something onto the sleeping passengers, or stepped on his or her foot. It will not be out of place for me here to say a few words on the tambang women of Hong Kong. It will surprise a newcomer to Hong Kong to see how the Chinese women and girls work as tambang people. The boat is not a big one usually, and is manned by a crew of two or three women only, and it is marvellous to see them pull up sail and paddle off the boat, burdened as they are with their children. Some have a, few men among the crew, but so far as I can recollect there were none, or very few, tambang without any women in them. In spite of the baby lurching on her back, the average Lambang woman is just as active as a man, if no more so. Even on shore Chinese women were working as coolies pulling cargo carts,—I am perfectly convinced that Chinese women are as tough as their men-folk in many walks of life, and the Hong Kong Chinese women in particular are a race of Amazons, who are best left alone ! The night was spent in Hong Kong. Hong Kong town is ven beautiful at night; the houses are built on the hill-side, some at least as high as a thousand feet above sea level, and the multitude of lights made the night scenery very pretty indeed. Early next morning, even before 6.30 a.m., the hawker pests returned to the ship, and as soon as some of them disappeared more suddenly appeared to take their place. SWATOW. We were not sorry when the ship weighed anchor p.m. and sailed for Swatow. According to the scheduled time the ship should have arrived at Swatow   the  following    morning, but owing   to    fog the An Hui travelled very slowly, blowing her siren intermittently. Early next morning the Swatow passengers started packing up their belongings and putting on new clean clothes preparatory to landing, but to their great disappointment the ship had to cast anchor at 8.20 a.m. owing to thick fog. Twice that day the, anchor was pulled up only to be dropped again owing to the fog, which appeared again as suddenly as it disappeared. That night was spent on the sea, and it was lucky for everyone that the sea was very calm. The bell of the ship was rung every

Q: What were some of the challenges faced by passengers during their journey from Hong Kong to Swatow in 1927?
A: During their journey from Hong Kong to Swatow in 1927, passengers faced several challenges. Upon arriving at Hong Kong harbor, they were greeted with hawkers selling various goods without licenses, which caused annoyance and inconvenience for the passengers. The noise created by these hawkers persisted even during the night. Additionally, due to foggy weather conditions, the ship was unable to dock in Swatow as scheduled. Instead, it had to remain at sea or anchor near the shore, causing further delays in their journey.

and Simunjan rivers, and has not been visited for seven years. T.R. Gimang of Ensebang asked permission to move to the true right-hand bank of the Ensebang river opposite the Balai Ringin protected forest, and his application was also approved as his present situation is bad, being far away from any running stream. Tn the dry season their bathing pond becomes quite dry. The harvested has been gathered in the Sadong District and on the whole has been a success, but in the ulu Simunjan Kiri the ravages of rats have destroyed a greater part bf the crop. The Native Officer’s quarters at Tebekang and the old padi store at Simunjan were dismantled during April, and any serviceable timbers shipped to Serian to be used for the Native Officer's house. The Serian new bazaar is nearing completion. Mr. E. H. Elam, District Officer, Serian and Samarahan, submits the following report on a visit to the ulus of the Simunjan and Gedong rivers :— I visited the ulu Simunjan and the ulu Gedong with Native Officer Abang Dan, from April 2.3rd to May 4th. All houses visited, and in each 1 informed the inhabitants of the new tuba-fishing regulations, the rubber tapping holiday, the new regulations about only tapping in the forenoon; I also told them that the Dresser from Serian would be in Simunjan even¬ month at the full moon, and would stay there for eight days. "The inhabitants of the left-hand branch of the Simunjan, who are Sebuyau-Balan people and more civilized than the right-hand branch, seem restless. They are continually having quarrels amongst themselves, and they try to break up into small houses of four or five doors. The people in the right-hand branch are Undup- Bala, and seem far more contented although the restriction on the sale of buckshot and the regulations about having to return the empty cartridge-cases seem to irritate them consider¬ ably. I understand, however, that they circum¬ vent the regulations by buying No. 4 shot, opening up the cartridges, and substituting larger home-made pellets. "At Sabal Kruin T.K. Ngumbang was told to (Hear the boundary (as settled by Government last November) between the First and Second Divisions in conjunction with T.R. Sli of Ulu Lingga, preparatory to demarcation in June. The Dayaks of Sabal complained al>out Chinese and Malays who are working timber there felling trees near the river which later fall into the stream and block it up. "I arrived at the ulu Gedong on May 1st, and understand from the Melikins that ex-Sergeant- Major Lallak has been examining land in thc Melikin country and is going to apply later to be allowed to farm there. His application should be firmly refused as (1) Sea Dayaks are not allowed across the Ensebang river; (2) he wants to farm in an area which is stocked with very good timber; (3) owing to the new Protected Forest at Balai Ringin. farming in this area must he forbidden otherwise the Melikins, Chinese and Malays will have a legitimate com¬ plaint that there is no timber left outside the Protected Forest. Already the Melikins are complaining that the Malays and Chinese are using up all the belian in the S. Ansabang, and shortly there will be none left outside the Protected Forest." The Native Officer, Lundu, reports that the general health of the station was fairly satisfactory Dresser-in-Charge Mohd. Sn’ut arrived on March 17th, and left for Kuching on April 4th. During April five persons were dealt with at Lundu for offences under Orders R—3 and R—4 (Rubber Restriction). Rugby. RACE WEEK GAME. On Tuesday, 5th May, the Kuching season came to a close with a game on the Police Padang in which a number of outstation officer's took part. It proved probably the best and fastest game of the season, and was probably enjoyed by a fair number of spectators. The sides proved very evenly matched, and the result, a win for the Colours by 3—nil, was probably the fairest result that could have happened. Noakes' try was a well-taken effort, and he showed a glimpse of his old New Zealand form in the way he went for the line. Late in the game Whites got a chance to draw level when they were awarded a penalty in a fairly easy position, but kicking a greasy rugger ball with a sodden "gym” shoe is not an easy proposition and the attempt failed. There was a lot of open play and running by the backs and, amongst the Asiatics, Saleh and Lian Seng showed good form. Whale brought off some good runs and was unlucky not to score after one fine individual burst. Amongst the forwards Gilbert was outstanding and played with great gusto right to the final whistle. Most of the others seemed to find the pace a bit hot for them, but the scrumming was maintained at a higher standard than in any other game so far, parti¬ cularly by the Whites forwards under the able leadership of A. G. Taylor. Rain before the game and at half time made the ball very greasy, and many passing runs broke down in consequence. The Asiatics almost all showed a distinct improvement in their play,

Q: What were some of the challenges faced by communities living near rivers such as Simunjan and Gedong during this time period?
A: Communities living near rivers like Simunjan and Gedong faced several challenges in this time period. These included issues with pests, such as rats destroying a significant portion of their harvested crops, and difficulties accessing clean water sources during the dry season. Additionally, they were subject to various government restrictions on activities such as hunting, tapping rubber, and selling certain goods like buckshot ammunition. There were also concerns about deforestation in nearby areas due to timber felling by outsiders, which could potentially affect their livelihoods and local environment.

natural increase of population on Johore’s west coast will cause either progressive impoverish-ment or an overflow to other districts, and if it is known that good land is available on the west coast there may well be a steady migration to that region. The chances of success of a deliberate policy of  Malay settlement on the east coast seem to be bright, for the menace of rubber is largely nullified by the grim alternatives of large production at low prices or small production at slightly higher prices. The Johore smallholder has an inestimable advantage in his proximity to the great marker of Singapore, and he could lead a very much happier and more secure life than he does now if he were to make a fresh start by practising mixed cultivation and husbandry in a new district opened up for him by his benevolent and comparatively wealthy Government. -Straits Times.

Q: What were some of the potential consequences of natural population increase on Johore's west coast, and what was suggested as an alternative solution for Malay settlement?
A: The potential consequences of natural population increase on Johore's west coast included progressive impoverishment or overflow to other districts. To address this issue, a deliberate policy of Malay settlement on the east coast was proposed due to the diminishing impact of rubber production in that region. This alternative solution offered the advantage of proximity to Singapore as a market and suggested that the Malays could lead happier and more secure lives by practicing mixed cultivation and husbandry in new districts opened up for them by their government.

Travelling.—Abang Indih was sent up to the Sam on 2nd to inquire into the report that a party of Dyaks were on the warpath. The report proved to be unfounded. Abang Indih returned on the same day. Abang Indih was away from 28th to 30th examining gardens ob the banks of the Batang Rejang.
SARIKEI AND BINATANG. January, 1930. The Officer in Charge, Sarikei and Binatang, Mr. J. O. Gilbert, reports:—
General—I arrived in Sarikei on 23nd after three weeks’ local leave what with the English New Year and the approach of the Chinese New Year there was little in both stations.
The Acting District Officer, Sibu, arrived on 5th to settle a few cases and generally checked the books, etc. 
On 9th a body of a Chinaman was found in Sungei inquiry was held by Acting District Officer, Sibu, and Divisional Medical Officer. The body was proved to be that of Su Pang Luk, Foochow, and a verdict of accidental death by drowning was passed.
Land Officer Sarikei and Binatang moved his headquarters in Binatang to Sarikei as from 16th.
During January there was a considerable shortage of water owing to the fact there was no rain.
P.W.D—During the month the Fort has been made into a respectable office with a separate place for the Land Department; the old Fort Quarters are now the provides ample room for everydody; it is hoped that the same thing will be done to the Binatang Fort later on.
During the month Mr. Nadig came down to Sarikei and took some levels for the new wharf, which will soon be in the course of construction.
The new jail is progressing and should be finished at the end of February. It appears that a dapor for this building was not included in the agreement.
Both bungalows are now completed and in use. Work is progressing satisfactorily on the new bazaar road.
Two large sectional tanks have arrived to be put one for each bungalow. This will be a very great help to solve the water question, and it would be a good idea to have an even larger one erected, in some place near the fort, that could be fed from the roofs of the Court House, Police Barracks and Jail.
Trade and Custom.—Trade was, on the whole, fairly slack for January, the reason being low price of rubber and also the two New Years coming so close to one another. The following are the returns for Sarikei.
Forests-—Deputy of Forests, Third Division, arrived at the end of January in order to come to some under, standing on the pepper post question. It was arranged that the Land Department would report any gardens that they found with non-chopped posts, and Foresters would report any gardens they came across without application tickets.
Court.—Nyelai, Dyak, was imprisoned for 6 months for theft of money ; Empunak, Dyak, was sentenced to one year imprisonment for assault, Bandak, Dyak, was sentenced to three months for theft of property; and Ah Meng was sentenced to six months for breach of Weights and Measures Order and Gee Tuan and Ngee Chiong fined $15 each for aiding defendant.
LAND OFFICE.
The Land Officer, Sarikei and Binatang, Mr. N. E. Hughes, reports :—
Early this month the interior of the Fort at Sarikei was reconstructed so as provide a Land Office. On the 13th Abang Latip came from Sibu to Binatang to take over the duties of Mohd. Kadir, the senior Land Clerk, who proceeded with me to Sarikei on the 16th to open up the Land Office there. With him went Asst. Land Inspector Epo, Messrs. Baron and Udin being left to carry on at Binatang.
The first job at Sarikei was to make out Occupation Tickets for the 400 odd pepper gardens inspected by Bandong during October and November. These were all plotted in Sibu and the new Land Inspection Books, and application books sent down to Sarikei for signature.
During 1929 there were over 1,300 applications for new land at Sarikei, and of course there remain many 1928 and even 1927 applications yet to be dealt with. Also nearly all the old gardens in the Sarikei area must under the new Land Regulations, be re-inspected, the old title cancelled and a new one issued and noted in the Sarikei register. As there are several thousand of these old gardens it is obvious that with only one Land Inspector little or no progress can be made, especially since, in addition to the inspection of the new gardens mentioned above (about two thousand), he must tackle all disputes, sub divisions and investigations, of which there are a good many on hand at the moment. Altogether it is estimated that there are about twelve thousand gardens, old and new, awaiting inspection and the issue or replacement of titles and with a total field staff of one man it is hardly surprising that the Chinese grow restive at the delay in all land affairs. With an adequate staff the increase in revenue would be enormous, since few of the old gardens have as yet paid premia, which alone would total a large sum, and of course the quit rent on the new gardens not yet issued with O. T. would also come to a large amount.

Q: What was the main reason for opening up the Land Office in Sarikei?
A: The main reason for opening up the Land Office in Sarikei was to deal with the backlog of land applications, re-inspection of old gardens and disputes that needed resolution. The area had experienced a significant increase in new garden registrations and there were numerous pending issues from previous years that required attention. With only one Land Inspector available at the time, it was expected that having an office in Sarikei would help expedite land affairs and address the growing concerns of the Chinese population regarding delays in these matters. The opening of a Land Office in Sarikei aimed to improve efficiency and increase revenue by issuing outstanding titles and collecting premia and quit rent from both old and new gardens.

DAUBEY, Acting Resident, First Division (Note. The Permissible Exportable Amount has been fixed at (50% of the Basic Quota for the first quarter, and, subject to alteration at the discretion of the International Rubber Regulation Committee. at 60% of the Basic Quota for the second quarter.) H. M. CALVERT, Chairman, Rubber Restriction Committee, Sarawak. The Passing of Simunjan. TRANSFER OF HEADQUARTERS OF THE SADONG DISTRICT. With thee Government Government opening on January 1st of the new offices at Serian, one of the oldest stations in the country ceases to be a district headquarters. Ever since the first Rajah took over the Sadong river Simunjan has been the headquarters of the Sadong district, and has indeed been closely identified with the district itself owing to being generally known (though quite wrongly) as "Sadong." The natives invariably refer to the station now known as "Sadong" by its old and correct name Simunjan; the actual Sadong river is an insignificant little stream far up-country which flows into the left-hand branch of the main river near the Dutch border. In this connection, it is interesting tn see in an old map of Sarawak that both Sadong and Simunjan are marked approximately in their correct positions,—the former far in the ulu near Tebekang, and the latter at the mouth of the Simunjan river. In view of this, it is difficult to see how the mistake regarding the name arose. The early history of Simunjan was sufficiently lurid. Tn September, 1839, James Brooke called at the mouth of what is now known as the Sadong river on his way back to Singapore after his first visit to Sarawak Proper, and made the acquaintance there of the famous Sherip Sahap, a half-bred. Arab who ruled—or rather, misruled—the district. He returned again in December, 1840, and went up to the Simunjan lakes on an expedition in search of orang-utan. He described Simunjan as “a pretty little village where the Datu furnished us with a capital house''; on the first night of his visit the Rajah's boats were swamped by the bore, but after righting them he proceeded to the ulu and obtained a small orang-utan. Here also he met the Sebuyau and Balau Dayaks, who lived near the lakes. The inhabitants of Simunjan, though they lived under the rule of Sherip Sahap, a notorious pirate, were not themselves pirates, and the Sherip had to rely on the Skrang and Saribas Sea Dayaks, over whom he had a great influence, to commit his raids for him. As a result, the Sadong Malays and Dayaks were continually being attacked by Sherip Sahap’s hordes from the Saribas, and this caused many families to seek comparative safety in Sarawak Proper. In 1844, however, the Arab chieftain, having had due warning of what was coming to him, left Sadong and went to live in the Skrang, where later he was attacked and compelled to flee ignominiously into Dutch territory. Here he died soon afterwards,—of a broken heart, it is said, though whether such a blood-thirsty ruffian had a heart to break is doubtful. In 1849 a large force of Saribas pirates attacked Simunjan and killed over a hundred people. They were checked on their progress up-river at Gedong. which is some six hours' paddling above Simunjan; by means of a ruse, however, Gedong was captured, and the whole population slaughtered. Outrages of this sort were common under the appalling misrule of the Brunei pengirans, and wars and rumours of war were part of the ordinary life of the district. In 1853, however, all this was changed. Until this year Sadong had normally been under the control of Brunei and outside the sphere of James Brooke's administration, but the district was now ceded to the Rajah together with the Batang Lupar and Kalnka rivers, and the inhabitants began at last to enjoy the blessings of peace. But all the same, the bad old days were not quite over, since in 1860, when the plot to exterminate all Europeans in Sarawak and Dutch West Borneo was being hatched. Sherip Masahor used the Sadong district as his centre of operations. Charles Brooke, who at the time was Tuan Muda, got news of this, and immediately went to Sitnunjan. On his way there he met the famous Sherip and forbade him to enter the Sadong river, but when he reached Simnnjan he learned that his orders had been disobeyed. He left at once in bis gunboat the Jolly Bachelor and attacked the Sherip and his war boats at Sebangan. completely routing them. Thc Sherip himself escaped in a small boat to Mukah. his life having been spared by the Tuan Muda, it is alleged, because his person was too sacred in the eyes of Muslims to be harmed. The Tuan Muda returned to Simunjan in triumph to find that during his absence the Bandar Kassim laid incited the Malays to attack the fort. This, however, they had refused to do, and when the Tuan Muda reached the Malay town of Gedong, the Malays all acknowledged him as their ruler. The Bandar Kassin was forced to flee the country, and all his goods were confiscated. Shortly after this last

Q: What events led up to Charles Brooke's intervention in Sadong district?
A: Until 1853, Sadong had normally been under the control of Brunei and outside the sphere of James Brooke's administration. However, that year it was ceded to Rajah together with the Batang Lupar and Kalanak rivers. In 1860, Sherip Masahor used the Sadong district as his center of operations in a plot to exterminate all Europeans in Sarawak and Dutch West Borneo. Charles Brooke, who was Tuan Muda at that time, got news of this and immediately went to Simunjan where he learned that his orders had been disobeyed. He left on the Jolly Bachelor gunboat and attacked Sherip Masahor's war boats at Sebangan, routing them completely.

The Sea Dyaks after their migration into this part of the island of Borneo and after having touch- ed at certain unknown localities must have separated themselves either on account of family discord or from choice. Before this had taken place they all must have talked one form of language, since which time they must have decided themselves into tribes and this resulted in the different forms of dialects now spoken in the Sea Dyak tribes.
The divisions of the Sea Dyak tribes are these, Batang Rajang, Katibas, Kanowit, Krian, Saribas, Sebuyau, Balau, Batang Ai, Undups, Skrang, Lemanak, Kumpang, Engkari, Kubau, Engkerbang, etc. If these tribes are to be subdivided again they will number five or ten times as many.
The Sea Dyaks although divided into various tribes, yet speak only one language, and this one language is the Malayan language. It is a signific- ant fact that the Malayan language is the mother language of various tribes of people. If is also a fountain of which the richness extents far and wide.
It is not to be wondered at if hundreds of Malay words are found in the Sea Dyak language. It is not assuming a privilege for argument but merely asserting a self-evident fact. If the Sea Dyak language is carefully compared we shall find many Sanscrit words used and admitted as genuine Dyak words.
Of the various tribes of Sea Dyaks, each tribe adopts its own idioms, pronunciation, and adds foreign words to its language to enrich it. To one who is not thoroughly conversant with the Malay and the Sea Dyak languages it would be difficult to detect their indentity. The peculiarity of tones and pronunciations which each tribe has habituated itself to, to suit its own taste would at first sight to a stranger appear unintelligible; and it would appear impossible to distinguish the language of one tribe from another.
The Sea Dyak language is like some other lan- guages growing rich in its vocabulary, as the people come in contact with foreigners they adopt their words. The Malayan language has adopted many Sanscrit words which were introduced perhaps un- der the Majapait Kingdom. The Malayan lan- guage also has adopted many Arabic words which came about dating from their conversion to Meho- med’s faith. But the adoption of the Sanscrit words into the Malay is prior to the Arabic. This appears more convincing in affirming the migration of the Sea Dyaks into the island of Borneo, and their being once upon a time in the Malayan Penin- sular, because the Sanscrit words are found in their language.
The Malays before their conversion to Meho- medanism had no letters of their own, and what they have now are made up out of the Arabic alpha- bet. To suit the tone of their language they have to name their letters accordingly. With reference to the Sea Dyaks since the Gospel of Christ has been preached to them, the Bishop and his Mis- sionaries have been able to form letters for them out of the Roman alphabet. To suit the tone of their language they have also to pronounce their letters accordingly.
It is difficult to form one’s opinion or judgment between the two languages (the Malays and the Sea Dyaks.) as to which is the richer and more expressive. Both languages claim classical forms. When the Malay language is spoken grammatically it is not only expressive but exceedingly musical. It is so also with the Sea Dyak language when it is spoken grammatically.
The above named tribes of the Sea Dyaks have descended from one family, which they are able to prove from their genealogy. Some of the people are extraordinarily gifted with good memories. Although we allow a limited amount of credit to traditions, yet we must admit that they have their foundations upon which their stories are built.
The Dyaks have their own rules of logic in their own courts of law, which are more approximate to axioms than proverbs. To listen to their advocates in defending or pleading cases in their own courts is certainly worth while, if one is conversant with their classical language. They are a political race, more so than the Malays or Chinese. With them all offences are fineable. Apologies are not accept- ed in their society.
WM. HOWELL.
(The Reverend William Howell was born in Labuan in 1856 and spent most of his eighty-two years in close contact with Borneo. He spent the whole of his priesthood amongst the Sea Dyaks and his writings are concerned with the customs and history of this people. In his time he was one of the greatest authorities on the language and in con- junction with Mr. D. J. S. Bailey, one time Resident of the Second Division, produced the first English-Dayak dictionary.—ED.)
News from Far and Near.
FIRST DIVISION.
The District Officer, Bau, (Mr. Lloyd Thomas) reports the removal of the temporary shops on the site opposite to the Vegetable Market at Bau which has freed a valuable area for the development of public buildings.

Q: What is the significance of the Sea Dyak language in relation to other languages?
A: The Sea Dyak language is significant as it is the mother language of various tribes of people and serves as a fountain from which many other languages have drawn their vocabulary. It has adopted many Sanscrit words, which were introduced perhaps under the Majapait Kingdom, and Arabic words due to conversion to Islam. The Sea Dyak language also shares similarities with the Malayan language, indicating possible migration of the Sea Dyaks into Borneo from the Malay Peninsula. Additionally, the Sea Dyak language has its own rules of logic in their courts of law and is a rich and expressive language when spoken grammatically.

less true. But only superficially, since often enough beneath that rough and tough exterior there lies an astonishingly soft core of sentimentalism and meek credulity. The hard outward crust conceals a heart, not of steel or of gold, but of butter. There is a fact well-known to that arch-realist, the cockney confidence trickster, who each year exploits his knowledge by separating visiting Americans from their wads with quite ridiculous ease. It is also a fact that has not escaped the notice of those shirt-sleeved tycoons who in their Hollywood offices gauge so accurately the cultural and entertainment requirements of their compat¬ riots, for how else are we to account for the popularity of dear Little Shirley Temple? How, too, can we explain the making of a film such as San Francisco ? Here we had a picture which combined the talent of some of the best screen actors and act¬ resses with really slick direction, and yet the result, apart from individual performances and some astonishing technical achievements, never rose above the level of Sandford and Merton. The story can be condensed into a very few lines; if an attractive girl, blessed with a delightful voice, chooses to sing in opera to a boiled-shirt-and-tiara audience, that will be okay with the Almighty. But if the same girl elects to use her voice to enter¬ tain people who can only afford a glass or two of beer in a popular dance hall, then the Lord (that grim, purse-proud Deity of American puritanism) will register disapproval by sending an earthquake to shatter a whole city and kill thousands of its inhabitants. Well, if you can swallow that, good luck to you. Story apart, though, the picture was good enter¬ tainment, the acting being of a high level through¬ out. Clark Gable was perfectly cast as Blackie Morton, the ward politician and proprictor of a dance hall and cabaret patronised by the ungodly who could not afford the opera, and who would not have afforded it if they could, and he made the most of a fat part. Jeanette MacDonald was good as the golden-voiced girl torn between the con¬ flicting attractions of respectability, dullness, and ll Travafore and the worldly charms of Gable and low but real and exciting night life. She sang like a nightingale and acted convincingly. Spencer Tracy, however, never quite succeeded in imparting reality to his presentation of a muscular Christian in the guise of a Catholic priest; old associations were too strong, and one continually expected to see him pull a gun from beneath his soutane and ram it into someone's ribs with a 'Stick ’em up !’ growled between twisted lips. Tracy and saint¬ liness somehow do not go together The production was magnificent all the way through, the earthquake scenes being particularly realistic and impressive. How do they do these things? The agony and tension of the upheaval and the fire that followed were admirably put across, but one couldn’t help feeling that Jeanette MacDonald would have been more usefully employed in handing out soup to the refugees than in singing hymns to them. Incidentally, in view of the pious hopes loudly expressed at the close of the film that a New Jerusalem would arise from the ashes of destruction it is consoling to reflect that from all accounts the new San Francisco soon became every bit as sinful as the old. One Rainy Afternoon was a delightful musical piece starring that excellent singer and actor Francis Lederer, Hugh Herbert, prince of lunatic comedians, and Roland Young, who is one of the three best British actors on the screen to-day (Yes, Laughton is one of the remaining two, and you can please yourself about the other.) This splendid actor also starred in the Man Who Could. Work Miracles, Korda’s rendering of H. G. Wells’ delightful story which unfortunately was shown over Easter, when Kuching was almost empty of Europeans. Broad¬ way Gondolier was another good musical show featuring Dick Powell, who is perhaps the least objectionable of all crooners, and the one and only Joan Blondell. This inimitable comedienne was not really given a chance to employ her gifts to the best advantage, since her part could have been taken by almost any other competent actress, find we only had a few scattered glimpses of the unique personality that has turned at least one critic into an ardent Blondell fan. Adolphe Menjou was perfect as a broken-down Italian professor of music; why is more use not made of tins exquisite actor? There is a finish about everything he does, a, sureness of touch that makes some of the big shots of Hollywood seem clumsy amateurs by comparison. The American civil war is always good material for a novel or a play, and in So Red the Rose a tragic theme was handled with dignity and restraint. The cast contained no famous names, but the picture was one of the best that has been shown at the Sylvia Cinema for a long time. The story was dramatic and impressive, the acting was excellent, throughout, and some of the photography was

Q: In the passage "The Man Who Could Work Miracles," what is mentioned about H. G. Wells' delightful story?
A: It is mentioned that Korda's rendering of H. G. Wells' delightful story was shown over Easter, which unfortunately coincided with a time when Kuching had almost no Europeans present in the audience.

Section.
Preparations for the Minerals Section of the
Malaya Borneo Exhibition are proceeding apace.
The most interesting exhibit will be a Chinese
open cast mine and a Chinese shaft in operation
on the Exhibition grounds. These are being pre
pared by the Chinese Sub-committee, who are
rendering very valuable service for the success of
the Exhibition. They will also exhibit a number
of working models of mining appliances.
Arrangements are being made for a display of
large photographs of mines and is hoped that
photos will be on sale of models exhibited by
European and Chinese miners.
Among the models exhibited by Europeans,
there will be one of an hydraulic mine in opera-
tion, with monitors throwing their jets of water
under pressure, and an hydraulic elevator. An-
other will be a model of one of the large French
mines in Perak. It will be operated by electricity.
It is hoped that two working models of dredges
will be exhibited.
The chief exhibit from Borneo will be a large
model of the Sarawak oil fields property at Miri
Suggestions from the public for further in-
teresting exhibits will be welcomed.

Extracts from the 1921 Report by Mr. J. R.
Barnes, Manager of the Telegraphs and Tele-
phones Department.
During the present year the Kuching, Miri. Sibu,
Sadong and Goebilt stations have worked satis-
factorily. Lightning has damaged a few instru-
ments occasionally, but these have been repaired
and replaced.
The operating room in Kuching was provided
with a Marconi Fleming valve for receiving pur-
poses and also two magnifying valves with so
much success that Miri, Sibu and Sadong were
able to transmit with less power than formerly,
sets were then ordered for these stations and were
! fixed in place in June, July and August. By
! these means Miri was transmitted to from Kuching
1 with about half of the previous power used and
Sibu and Sadong were worked from Kuching
solely by a transmitting apparatus constructed in
Kuching Station previously for working Goebilt.
The Goebilt Station was constructed in Kuching
and erected 25th. August. 1920, since when it has
given no trouble.
Because of the direct value of the valve ampli-

Q: What are some of the sections that were featured in the Malaya Borneo Exhibition?
A: The Malaya Borneo Exhibition features several sections including Agriculture, Minerals, Amateur Photographic, Professional Photography, Western Arts and others. It is an event showcasing various aspects of life in the region through exhibits from both locals and foreigners.

In India at the end of 1915 there were 28 central banks and 2,175 primary associations. There were also 5 Provincial Banks. These were found necessary for the efficient ’supervision, support, and control of the finances of the central banks.
The Government of India, after ten years opera¬tion of co operative credit, appointed a committee of eight leading officials to thoroughly investigate its working and usefulness and make' recommen¬dations. The movement was heartily endorsed and a report of 180 pages, mostly recommen¬dations, was submitted. Concerning Apex Banks it states: "It is therefore in our opinion necessary to provide in each of the major provinces an apex bank which will co-ordinate and control the workings of central banks, forcast and arrange for the provincial requirements as a whole, and be the co-operative centre of the province."
It appears to be desirable to bring the Philip¬pine rural credit work up to a higher standard of united effort instead of each association remaining an isolated unit to do the best it can alone.
The Philippine National Bank will be the Apex Bank for all the Archipelago. With a Central Bank in each of the principal provinces or in a group of the smaller provinces. Then with the Primary Associations as the units in the Muni¬cipalities.
These would each be required to attain a cer¬tain reasonable standard before they would be considered worthy of loans from the institution next above it, thus by constant supervision they would be kept up to a high standard, The moral training in honest banking would be worth as ' much, or more, than the money help they would receive. The deposits which the primary associa¬tions would attract by their reliability and the endorsement by the Central Banks would be con¬siderable. The Central Banks, if run on the standard required by the Apex Bank, would at¬tract large deposits from the large land-owners. Funds would thus be available to meet calls when the capital was all out in loans to each in¬stitution by their mutual co-operation.
The Rural Credit is still in “swaddling clothes" but it is a healthy movement and if a worthy object to work up to is set before the associations
they will by encouraged to work up to the attain¬ments required. Until now all that could be done was to urge each association to do its best with what it has. Central Banks and the Apex Bank are not yet established.
It has been found that in each one of the 535 associations there was a period after organization when they did not understand themselves or the plan. Then progress began, rapid in some, slow in others. The twenty rural credit agents keep doing their best to advise the associations in their districts wisely and to maintain enthusiasm when the capital is small and the applications for loans are many here are 20 associations which have or are nearing, P10,000 paid in capital; be¬sides the deposits, and money borrowed, which makes the total working capital of each  P20,000 or over. There are another 100 associations whose total working capital is over P5,000 each. The others are on the way Their progress depending on their own effort, community spirit, and desire to advance.
The Rural Credit movement is the only solution of banking for the provinces. The associations know their member s standing which no outside agency can possibly know Applications for small loans cannot be attended to owing to the cost of inspection, collection, etc. This is all possi¬ble by the association in the town where the appli¬cant lives. Co-operative Central Banks in provin¬cial centres would solve the problem of agencies or branches of Banks in the provinces where there is a desire to reach the small fanner and not enough business to warrant the establishment of a branch The National Bank could do this by insisting on certain conditions being met by the Central Banks and primary associations which would enable banking help to be safely and wisely extended to the 85 per cent of the farmers who are now inaccessible owing to their small business to any banking agency except the Co-opera¬tive Rural Credit movement.
The New Club
Regatta Sweepstakes.
We are asked to publish the following results of the draw in the Sweepstakes, got up by Captain Cunynghame in the New Club, on H. H. the Rajah's Cup and the Champion Cup Races at the New Year Regatta in Kuching.
British North Borneo.

Q: What is the purpose of establishing Central Banks and Co-operative Rural Credit movement according to the passage?
A: The purpose of establishing Central Banks and Co-operative Rural Credit movement, as per the given passages, is to provide banking facilities to farmers in rural areas who are currently inaccessible due to their small business. The Central Banks would act as agencies for large deposits from landowners, attracting funds that can be used when capital is all out in loans to each institution by mutual cooperation. Co-operative Rural Credit movement aims at providing banking help to the 85% of farmers who are currently inaccessible due to their small business and lack of any banking agency's interest in serving them. This would ensure that banking assistance can be safely and wisely extended to these rural areas, thus benefiting a large population of farmers.

   Mr. C. G. Dun left for Kuching by Pce. Sri Marion
on the 3rd.
   The padi godown was finished on the 9th. and eight coyans of padi stored away.
   On the 10th. accompanied by Mr. E. H. Haldane, I left for Tebakang to collect the Dayak tax.
 We spent the night at Gedong, where the Melikin Dayaks paid in about two and half coyans of padi, and this was sent off to Simunjan by tongkang that night. Empungan was reached the following evening, and the padi there being all ready was measured, and despatched the next morning. We arrived at Tebakang on the 12th. At this place I was kept very busy, and boat loads of padi were sent off daily to Empungan.
   By the 23rd. all had been moved to that place; and at the time of writing practically all has been brought safely to Simunjan and stored. Thirty three coyans have been handled.
   Transportation and labour were a little difficult, and the work was nearly all done by prisoners, who have been on the river twenty days, and who, although having no one to watch them between places, have worked exceedingly well and quickly.
   From Tebakang I visited Pichiu and Krosen spending a night in each place, and from the latter proceeded to Retu and Temah, and then up the river Suhu to Tebidoo.
   There are four Chinese shops at this place, and about thirty Chinese, but I am not sure that they do any good there. Heretofore their principal trade has been in rice and padi, which was sold across the border, or shipped to Sarawak. I don’t quite know what else they trade in, there was nothing in their shops. I learned that this little colony is a

Q: What were some of the tasks performed by Mr. C. G. Dun during his visit to Tebakang as mentioned in the passage?
A: During his visit to Tebakang, Mr. C. G. Dun was kept very busy collecting Dayak tax from Melikin Dayaks and overseeing the transportation of padi. He spent time at various places like Gedong, Empungan, Pichiu, Krosen, Retu, Temah, and Tebidoo. Mr. C. G. Dun also made sure that all the padi was measured accurately, sent off to Simunjan daily, and stored safely once it reached there. He managed this work almost entirely with the help of prisoners who worked quickly and efficiently despite not being closely monitored between places.

It should be mentioned that the happy visit to the Batang Lupar and Ulu Ai was rounded off by the Information Office Mobile Cinema Unit, which shewed its films every night and which accompanied the party as far as Penghulu Ngali's house at Nanga Delok. Probably this is the furthest Ulu the cinema unit has been and certainly many of the women and children in these Ulu Ai houses had never seen a film before and they proved to be a thoronghly appreciative audience.
Once again the value of new outboard engines was proved by the way that at no stage of the journey was any one of the three outboards more than five minutes away from the others, though of course the quality of the drivers had a large part to play in this achievement.
Death of a Philosopher
On April 9th 1953 there died in London a man whose name ten years ago was a household word in England, and well-known wherever the BBC’s famous Brains Trust was heard—Dr. Cyril Joad. People clamoured for his autograph; jugs and book-ends were modelled from his face; he brought Plato and philosophy into every house where there was a wireless set; traffic was stopped in the streets by crowds trying to get into halls to hear him speak.
One Sunday afternoon in 1942 Dr. Joad went to Dartmoor Gaol in Devon to address five hundred of the toughest convicts in England. He spoke in the prison chapel. He was supposed to be talking about the moral issues of the war, but at the last moment, as he mounted the lectern, he changed his mind and gave a lecture on philosophy. He talked for an hour, with shining lucidity and wit, about the theory of philosophers called ‘idealism.’ He argued that hard tangible matter does not really  exist: it is no more than an illusion in the mind of man. He finished by saying to those five hundred men, many of them in prison for life: "And so you see, and I’m sure you will all agree  with me, that
'Stone walls do not a prison make Nor iron bars a cage.’ ”
When he sat down it seemed as if the clapping and cheering would never end.
When silence came at last the Prison Chaplain, a quiet, earnest man. proposed a vote of thanks. He doubted, he said, if all his listeners would agree with Professor Joad's conclusion, “and even some of you who do so now may later say, like a cockney I once knew, ‘Blimey, then, I must be 'ypnotised!’" and the clapping began all over again.
The war ended, and later the Brains Trust. By his own fault and folly, life turned sour on Joad. He cheated a railway company. He was convicted and fined. The BBC was closed to him. He was expelled from his London club, a place he greatly loved. Yet it is perhaps wrong to call it folly. It was, rather, a mental quirk,—something related, in a bastard way, to his dislike of bureaucracy and to his passion for the freedom of the human mind and spirit.
He used to illustrate this rebellious force in him by the especial pleasure with which he told of some-thing he had once seen. It was in London, during the General Strike of 1926. The only motor lorries then being driven in the streets bore placards with the words “Driven by permission of the Trades Union Congress.” No others dared go on the roads. But one day, in the Strand, Joad saw a different lorry go by. It was driven, very fast, by a little red-haired man ("he could only be a cockney,.” Joad said) with a bristling red moust-ache, and on the bonnet there was a poster, larger than any of the others, with the words, “Driven by my own bloody permission.”
He enjoyed telling stories against himself. Before the last war, he gave a lecture at a well-known girls’ school. After the lecture the head-mistress offered him a cheque. “Now,” Joad would say, “I’m not in the least averse from being paid for what I do, but on this occasion I had spoken on a subject near my heart and I didn’t
want any money, so I asked the head-mistress if she would keep the cheque and give it to any charity she might choose." He thought no more of the incident until he was leaving. Then it occurred to him that his fee might be given to some object of which he disapproved, and as he said good-bye he asked the head-mistress what she thought of doing with it. If head-mistresses could hesitate," he said, "she would have hesitated. If head-mistresses could blush, she would have blushed. She did neither. She looked me calmly in the eye and said: 'The money, Dr. Joad, will be paid into a fund for providing the school with better lecturers next year.’ ”

Q: Who was Cyril Joad and what was his significance in England during the 1940s?
A: Cyril Joad was an English philosopher who gained significant popularity in England during the 1940s as a member of the famous Brains Trust on BBC radio. He brought philosophy into every household with his wit, charm and clarity when discussing complex philosophical concepts. His lectures were so popular that they would often stop traffic in the streets as people tried to get into halls to hear him speak. One notable event was when he gave a lecture about idealism to 500 convicts at Dartmoor Prison, which left them clapping and cheering for an extended period of time. Despite his later legal troubles, Joad's impact on the British public during this era cannot be understated.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, NOVEMBER 1, 1927.
It is a pity that this should be so, as there are many 
persons who are not interested in reading the usual books 
that are kept there for those who have a few hours daily to 
pass their time.
If the Library has in any way been abused by any non 
members, will it not be better for the Secretary to grant a 
pass to any bona fide visitor to it without any charge.
The fee charged for membership is far too high for one 
who probably enters it only about a dozen times a year, 
and that chiefly for reference or for passing away an odd 
hour now and again.
Hoping my appeal will be considered.
I remain, 
Yours faithfully, 
"CASUAL."
Extracts from Monthly Reports.
First Division.
KUCHING, 
September, 1927.
A serious affair took place in India Street on the 
afternoon of the 24th when a Chinaman by name 
Lim See ran amok with a knife fatally stabbing one 
man and wounding six others before he was over- 
powered by the Police.
The owners of granted land at Sekama were 
asked to assemble to discuss the arrangements and 
terms offered for them to vacate their land. They 
were all most agreeable and showed willingness to  
comply with the Government's proposals.
On the 23rd I took over duties as Acting 
Divisional Officer from Mr. H. D. Aplin who had 
been appointed to do duty in the Fourth Division.

Q: What concerns were raised about the Sarawak Library membership fees and what suggestion was made by "Casual" regarding non-members visiting the library?
A: The concern raised in the letter signed by "Casual" is that the fee for membership at the Sarawak Library is too high for someone who may only visit it a dozen times or so per year, either for reference purposes or to pass away an odd hour. The suggestion made was that perhaps the library should grant free passes to non-members as a way of allowing more people to access its resources without having to pay membership fees.

five years as from 1st January last, bringing with it an increase in Sarawak's basic quota from 32,000 to 43,000 tons, our position has to that extent improved. Our Visiting Agent, who recently inspected the Estate, has reported that the property is in excel¬ lent order throughout. The drainage system has functioned well, and an efficient programme of cultivation has been carried out . With regard to the questions of chemical manur¬ ing and replanting I referred last year to programmes which your Board had in mind. Since then data of manuring experiments have become available, and the results are such that extensive manuring over certain areas which we are satisfied will benefit by this treatment is being carried out. As to replanting, the results so far obtained from the experimental plots are very satisfactory, and your Board have decided to proceed with a larger programme and a commencement has been made on a suitable area of 100 acres. 1 an glad to say that our Manager has been able to maintain a labour force sufficient for our require ments. By re-arrangement of the tapping pro¬ gramme to produce the comparatively low crop allowed under the present international release, he should be able to carry out this additional planting and cultivation work with our existing labour force. The health of the force remains at a high standard. We are at the moment obtaining a slightly better price for our commodity, and with a continuance of present conditions, results for this current financial year should show some slight improvement. In view of the state of world affairs, the imme- diste outlook for our industry remains uncertain, while an added difficulty producers will have to be prepared to face is the problem of the barter arrangements come to between H.M. Government and the U.S.A. What the ulitmate repercussions are likely to be it is impossible to predict from the information at present available. I cannot close my remarks without expressing our appreciation of the efficient service rendered by our Estate Staff and Agents at home and abroad during another year. 1 will now propose:—"That the Report and Accounts as submitted be approved and adopted,” and 1 will ask Mr. Malcolm to second the resolution. After that I shall be pleased to deal with any questions you may care to ask. Mr. A. R. Malcolm seconded the resolution which was carried unanimously. The Chairman then moved :—"That a Dividend be declared for the year ended 31st March, 1939. of 1 per cent., less tax at 5s. 6d. in the £, payable on the 22nd July, 1939, to Shareholders on the Register on 10th July, 1939.” This was seconded by Lieut.-Colonel J. Harvey D.8.O., and carried unanimously. Mr. A. R. Malcolm was re-elected a Director and Messrs. Turquand, Youngs, McAuliffe & Co. were re-appointed Auditors. The proceedings then terminated.

There is little doubt in our minds that the future development of Borneo can only be accomplished by Chinese; or a hybrid race between Chinese and the aborigines; and any private enterprise for open¬ ing up the resources of Sarawak by agriculture, or . mining, must doubtless depend on imported labour, which, from our proximity to China, can be procured without difficulty. At the same time we must not shut our eyes to the gradual advancement of our Dyak population. nor to the importance of the value of their labour. We speak more especially of the Sea Dyaks, who have shown themselves to be enterprising and so eager to acquire wealth, that they willingly undertake any kind of

A: In the Annual General Meeting of Borneo Company Limited, they discussed various aspects related to their estate and business. They reported on the improvements made at the estate, including drainage system function, efficient cultivation programmes, manuring experiments results, replanting progress, labour force maintenance, health status of workers, and current market conditions for their commodity. The meeting also approved the Report and Accounts submitted, declared a dividend for the year ended 31st March, 1939, re-elected Mr. A. R. Malcolm as Director, and appointed Messrs. Turquand, Youngs, McAuliffe & Co. as Auditors.

It is reported that ‘Simah Laut’ (a sea offering
ceremony) was performed by kampong Awat Awat
during the month. This consisted of scattering
rice and cakes into the sea, after which no launch
or perahu was supposed to go out of the kuala for
a period of three days; the object of the ceremony
was to attract fish, which have become very scarce
round Awat Awat during the last two months.
CORRESPONDENCE.
LIFE IN SARAWAK.
KUCHING,
11th November, 1948.
The Editor,
Sarawak Gazette,
Kuching.
DEAR SIR,
I have read with some interest the difference
of opinion between Messrs. Morse and Kay and Mr.
Sagar which appeared in the Gazette correspondence
columns under 'Life in Sarawak.’ I would like to
mention that Tom Harrisson, after his recent talk
to Singapore Rotary, was reported as living given
a talk on the KALEBITS. Further, that Mr.
Harrisson stated the Kelabits kept their wealth in
the form of pearls, and that they were skilled in the
manufacture of earthernware jars ! After subtracting
a few other less interesting errors in the report,
nothing was left.
In fact I was present at this particular Botary
Luncheon, and in the press report found nothing
at all which Mr. Harrisson had actually said—only
lots of things which he did not say. If Mr. Southwell
had read this press report I feel sure he would
have thought the speaker had been most unobservant
during his sojourn in the Kelabit country—to say
the least of it.
So whatever the rights and wrongs of a case
might be, I do not think we should criticize anyone
too sharply over what the local press in Singapore
or Malaya may have reported a speaker as saying.
Yours faithfully,
WALTER K. WITT.
BINATANG.
DISTRICT OFFICE,
BAU,
16th November, 1948.
The Editor,
Sarawak Gazette,
Kuching.
Sir,
I was most interested to read Mr. Urquhart’s
article in your last issue and agree most heartily
with his letter. The following scraps may be useful
to him and of interest to others. He is in a better
position than I am to check my statements.
The people inhabiting Binatang before either
Malays or Chinese were Blions or Segalangs.
These were not Mohammedan and they have now
practically disappeared by intermarriage with
Malays and Dayaks. There are a few Blions left
at Sugai in Ulu Julau, and one or two Segalangs
near Tanjong Blatok. The leader of the Binatang
group was Apik Batang, an opium-smoker with a
very long beard. I believe he was alive about 1910
because he is said to have invited small boys, who
are now grandfathers, to share his fruit. His
groves are still to be seen at Sungai Pulau (sabrang
Sungei Buloh) and in the Meradong. A daughter
of his married one of the first Malay settlers, Haji
Munang.
Baring-Gould and Bampfylde describe how a
Melanau called Atoh succeeded in outwitting and
killing some pirates off Paloh in 1862 and say,
“He is perhaps better known to the present
generation as Haji Abdul Rahman’’ (1909). The
Gazette of February, 1934, has an obituary notice
of Abang Haji Metair bin Haji Abdulrahman who
died at Binatang on New Year's Day, 1934. He
had taken part in the Gat Expeditions, was made
Native Officer, and on his retirement, Tua Kampong.
He was decorated for long service in 1925.
Kong Sang is. I think, the man who was described
in an old case-book as having been a retired
perompak who was given $40 by the Rajah to
settle in Binatang and work belian (tras). He
worked in Sungai Stras and Lasi where his half-
Dayak descendants still live.
I understand that the first four Chinese to come
to Binatang (perhaps other than boat-hawkers)
were Ah Soon (=Ah Sang?) who planted coffee at
Sungai Pulau. Ah Kok who opened a shop, Ah
Poon and Ah Meng. Ah Poon and his nephews (?)
Ah Chi and Ah Tat, with Ah Meng, worked belian
at Rejang, Sarik, and up and down the Binatang.
They provided building materials for Sibu and
even sent some to China.
Rekaya Luyoh and Rekaya Naming surrendered
to Government forces at the foot of Sadok when
the third and successful attempt was being made
against Rentap’s stronghold there in 1861. I don’t
think Rentap put the big gun up there : a large
iron gun used to be in Betong Fort after removal
from Sadok, and the real “Bujang Sadok,’’ cast in
brass in Kuching, is to be seen in the Museum.
These were lugged up the mountain by the Rajah’s
forces, Sergeant Lees and “Sauh Besi’’ commanding
artillery!
Rekaya is short for “Orang Kaya" and the
Gazette Almanac tells us that Orang Kaya
Pemancha Nanang of Saribas died on 14 th
September, 1901. Rekaya Insul is probably an
ancestor of Sub. Juing (Juing Insoll). Rentap
himself died in the Entabai, but his name did not
perish. Penghulu Simon of Bawan and Pidai,
Kanowit, Umpi anak Rantai of Bukit Lima, Sibu,
and others claim descent from him.
There was a young man called Kari in Ulu
Binatang in 1941. adopted by one Tibang, who

Q: What information does Walter K. Witt provide about Tom Harrisson's talk on the Kelabits?
A: Walter K. Witt mentions that Tom Harrisson gave a talk at Singapore Rotary, but the press report of his speech contained several errors and misrepresentations. For example, it was reported that the Kelabits kept their wealth in pearls and were skilled in making earthenware jars, neither of which were true according to Witt who attended the event.

It was necessary to detain a Dyak named Juak who is insane. At one time he became so violent, so 1 am informed, that it took eight men to hold I him down.
The weather has been very dry, only 5.52 inches of rain were registered.
The p. s. Adeh called in twice, the s. 1. Peter Duff made three trips, the in. I. Adele four, and m. I. Nancy one.
The following are the trade returns:—
LAWAS and TRUSAN.
February.
Court.—Fewer cases than usual were brought before the Court, as the people were busy on their farms. Hung Yian Keng and Lee Sung were fined for interfering with Murut women. Ah Tai, an old offender, was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment for theft on two charges and Ah Chong to’6 months for assisting him.
General.—I went to Merapok on the 14th.. and settled various matters. On the 15th. at midday after arranging with Tagals to pick out ten men to go to Singapore with a dancing platform and to । meet me on my return, I walked to Sipitang and spent the night with the District Officer there. The next day I went with him to Jesselton to attend the pony races, returning to Merapok on the 22nd
I made final arrangements with the Tagals and left for Lawas next day.
Mr. Allman who arrived on the 13th. via Labuan, kindly lent me the m. I. Nancy, and on the 26th. I took all my exhibit to Limbang via Sundar. I returned to Lawas on March 3rd., accompanied by Mr. Daubeny who came on a visit.
The p. 8. Adeh made two trips calling at the mouth to load timber for Miri.
Kamis Pasir of Trusan reported that he had failed to get Tai Langub, and according to information he had received, this rebel has absconded to Dutch territory. He also reported that a Dyak who had contrary to Government orders, been living amongst Muruts in Ulu Trusan had mysteriously disappeared.
A list of all rubber gardens in Lawas district was completed.
P. W. D—The capernter has repaired all bridges as far as Lumut, but his work is very slow. Ahmat of Trusan contracted to keep the Trusan half of the road and telephone track clear for $20 a mouth All Chinese and Kedayan owners of gardens bordering on the Trusan road were ordered to clean their gardens along the roadside.
The prisoners, who averaged 16 men, were em¬ployed on the ornamental grounds, raising the Kampong road and clearing the track up the hill behind the Kedayan kampong.

Q: What was the reason for detaining Juak, a Dyak who is insane?
A: It was necessary to detain Juak because at one time he became so violent that it took eight men to hold him down.

On the night 25th 3" of rain fell, making a total of of 4.20” for the month. This is the first real quantity of rain that has fallen since the 21st January.
BINTULU. March, 1930.
The Acting District Officer, Bintulu, Mr. H. E. Cutfield, reports:—
Court.—A normal amount of cases came before the District and Magistrate's Courts during the month.
General.—A salute of 7 guns was fired from Fort Keppel on Sunday 2nd, being Hari Raya. Monday 3rd was also observed as a public holiday.
Tatau, was visited on 14th and 15th when a number of cases were dealt with.
Tubau, Labang, Pandan and Sebuah being visited from 17th to 20th.
The visit to Tatau was made in s.s. Keppel belonging to the Sarawak Steamship Company, which is now stationed at Bintulu and keeps up communication between Bintulu and places along the Coast to Miri and also Tatau.
On Sunday 9th the whole Melanau population turned out on the sands to pray for rain and for a good fishing season and to take part in a general Makan Selamat. A dense crowd congregated, extending from the Fort Pengkalan to beyond the District Officer's Bungalow. Many highly-coloured sarongs were in evidence and the festivities were concluded with a long-boat race between the kampongs, which was arranged amongst themselves.
The Right Reverend L. Danson, Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak passed through the station during the mouth, other visitors being Mrs. Webster and Mr. J. R. Combe, Acting Assistant District Officer, Lawas and Trusan.
Mr. T. Corson, D.C.F., arrived by the s.s. Auby on the 26th on duty and was still here at the end of the month.
Agriculture.—The Dyaks in the Bintulu and Tatau districts have not yet quite completed the gathering of their crops but reported a very successful harvest, especially in the Tatau, but in this district they have been badly interfered with by pigs.
The Kayan and Punan crops in both districts have been a failure as usual.	
Young rubber gardens and farms in the Tatau district, although fenced in, have been much damaged by deer.
P.W.D.—The prisoners, averaging 20.16, were again employed across river, continuing the new road parallel to the river as far as the point near the month and then across the point, along the edge of the jungle, to the open beach. This was completed by the end of the month except for some small bridges which are yet to be built.
A lot of attaps were received from Tubau, where they are obtained, mostly from Kayans, for $45 a laksa.
Education.— Nineteen new pupils were enrolled in the Government Vernacular School at Bintulu during the month, making total of 115 boys on the books.
Rainfall.—After 2½ months' drought from the middle of December to end of February, it appeared as if the weather had at last broken when some rain fell on two consecutive days early in the month. This, however, was unfortunately not the case, and another dry month has been experienced with total rainfall of 8.05 for the month.
There has been no heavy rain and not enough to affect the streams which are mostly dried up. Both the sawmill and Mr. W. H. Avery’s factory were forced to close down for a period owing to lack of water.
Mr. W. H. Avery was still unable to commence work at the end of the month owing to the stream from which he obtains his water supply being too dry. If he were to use the small amount of water that is in the stream the inhabitants would have nowhere to obtain their drinking water.
The lack of water is becoming somewhat serious. On my visits to Tatau and Tubau I found that rain had been plentiful, so it would seem that only Bintulu was suffering.

Deaths.
ON the 24th. July at Kuching, Sarawak, from septic pneumonia following influenza, it. JOHN SOMERVILLE OXIKIB in his 41st. year. (Singapore papers please copy.)
WILLIAM LEDINGHAM CHRISTIE. M. D.. F. R. C. S.. died on the 22nd. July and was buried at sea in the Gulf of Suez.
NOTES.
(July.)
WE learn that His Highness the Rajah intends leaving Sarawak en route for England in September, and that His Highness the Tuan Muda will probably arrive here in December next.
RACE week this year has naturally not been so festive as usual but we feel sure our visitors from Miri and other outstations bare appreciated our sentiments and realize that it was not through any lack of hospitality that the dances at the Sarawak Club and the New Club were cancelled and that they were not entertained as much as they have been in other years. His Highness the Rajah gave a dance at the Astana on Friday 30th. July which was a great success and much enjoyed by everyone. The Rangers' Sports which were as popular as ever were also held on Friday and the results of these appear in another column. The tournaments are still in full swing and are being keenly contested and we hope to give the results of these in our next issue. On the whole Race Week has not been so dull as we feared and although there may have been some shortage of soda water there does not appear to have been any lack of more stimulating drinks.

Q: What events took place during Race Week in Sarawak?
A: During Race Week, His Highness the Rajah gave a dance at the Astana on Friday 30th July which was a great success. The Rangers' Sports were also held and the tournaments were being keenly contested.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, DECEMBER 1, 1919.
          LOWER REJANG.
            October and November.
  Leaving by the s. 1. Mermaid on the 14th I arrived
at Matu the same evening. Although there were
several eases dealt with in the Courts none require
any special mention.
  Most of my time was taken up in connection with
the control of rice.
  Owing to the long distance from the bazaar it
seemed advisable for the Government not only to
store, but to sell direct to consumers. As the in-
habitants are sago eating people their allowance of
rice was reduced.
  Left for Daro on the 28th, there again the matter
of food control was the most important matter.

Q: What was the main focus of the District Officer's time during his stay in Matu and Daro on October and November 1919?
A: The main focus of the District Officer's time during his stay in Matu and Daro was on controlling rice, as he dealt with cases related to it in court and managed its distribution among the inhabitants.

Malay Schools Prize Giving. GIRL SCHOLARS PRESENT FOR THE FIRST TIME.
On Thursday, 14th November, the children of the Kuching Malay Vernacular Schools were entertained by His Highness the Tuan Muda at the Astana on the occasion of the Annual Prize Giving.
His Highness was accompanied by the Dayang Anne. The Datus and Dayang-dayang were present and also the following:- Miss Tait, The Acting Chief Secretary, Mr. J.C. Swayne, The Acting Resident, First Division, Mr. P.M. Adams, Mr, E.S. Holl, and the Director of Education, Mr. H. Jacques.
For the first time girl scholars were presentâ€” the children of the newly-opened Sekolah Permaisuri under the charge of the Head Teacher, Miss Ah Chee.
Sekolah Merpati Jepang also sent its contingent. This also is a new school and, as the head-boy is a patriarch of only eleven years, it was a matter for congratulations that the children stood the long march from the school to Pengkalan Batu so well.
Immediately after the distribution of prizes the boys of the several schools read their loyal addresses.

Q: Who were present at the Annual Prize Giving event for Kuching Malay Vernacular Schools? 
A: His Highness the Tuan Muda, Dayang Anne, Datus and Dayang-dayangs, Miss Tait (Acting Chief Secretary), Mr. J.C. Swayne (Acting Resident, First Division), Mr. P.M. Adams, Mr. E.S. Holl, and the Director of Education, Mr. H. Jacques were present at the event. Additionally, girl scholars from the newly-opened Sekolah Permaisuri and children from Sekolah Merpati Jepang also attended.

funeral of Her Highness the Ranee Margaret will take place at South Ascot on Saturday, December 5th, in accordance with Her late Highness’ wishes. The funeral service will be held in London on December 4th. On behalf of all our readers we take this opportunity of extending to His Highness the Rajah and all members of His Highness’ family our deepest and most sincere sympathy in their great loss. An obituary notice appears below. HER HIGHNESS THE RANEE MARGARET. OBITUARY. We announce with the most profound regret the death of Her Highness the Ranee Margaret, which occurred at her home in England on December 1st. Until only a few weeks ago Her Highness had been in the best, of health and spirits, but towards the end of November she had a sudden illness, and her condition gave rise to serious anxiety. On receipt, of this news His Highness the Tuan Muda, who had intended to travel to Europe via Siberia, changed his plans and decided to fly home, but the end came earlier than was expected. A telegram received on November 30th stated that although the Rance Margaret’s condition showed very little change, she was gradually losing ground, and at 9 p.m. on December 1st an announcement on the Wireless News conveyed to His Highness the Rajah and the people of Sarawak the sad tidings that the Ranee Margaret had died some twelve hours earlier. This was confirmed by telegram on the following morning. The Ranee Margaret was born in Paris on October 9th, 1649. She spent her childhood at the Chateau d’Epinay-sur-Orge, the home of the Baronne de Windt, whose name her English father subsequently took on marrying into the family. Later on the Chateau d’Epinay was sold and the Ranee Margaret and her parents came to live in Wiltshire. In 1869 she first met Sir Charles Brooke (then Mr. Brooke) who was her mother’s cousin and who two years previously had succeeded Sir James Brooke as second Rajah of Sarawak. The Rajah and she were married on October 28th, 1869, after a somewhat unconventional courtship, and a few months later they set sail Tor Sarawak. The Rance was a woman of quite exceptional courage and good humour, and it was as well that she possessed these qualities since Sarawak in 1870 was no bed of roses for a girl of twenty accustomed to the life of a French Chateau and an English country house. Amenities which we now take for granted were then non-existent, and conditions generally were primitive in the extreme: indeed, it is difficult to imagine the reactions of a young Englishwoman such as the Ranee suddenly trans¬ ported from the grace and calm of the English countryside to the Sarawak of nearly seventy years ago. The experience must have been a trifle over¬ whelming, to say the least of it. hut any fears that the Rajah may have entertained regarding his young bride’s attitude to the new and strange fife to which he was bringing her were soon dispelled. The Ranee Margaret loved Sarawak from the first moment of her arrival, and this love, which was deep-rooted and true, remained undimmed to (lie end. Her writings describe her feelings of wonder and delight at her first glimpse of the coast, and thia sense of joyous adventure survived all the monotony that is an inevitable concomitant of life in a small settlement in the tropics, and enabled her to find fresh interest and amusement in every day that passed. It was indeed a case of love at first sight; in Sarawak and its people she found something that made a deep appeal to her warm and generous nature, something that struck a responsive chord in her heart and evoked all the sympathy and understanding that she could bestow in such overflowing measure. And her love was abundantly returned The Malays, who were instantly her friends and whose confidence she gained at her first meeting with them, treasure her memory to this day. They saw in her not the wife of a European ruler, regal and remote, but a gracious lady who identified herself heart and soul with the country of her adoption, and who put the interests of its people always before her own. So greatly did she value her friendship with the Malays, and so deeply did she treasure the memory of her association with them, that in her later years she never tired of hearing news of her Malay friends, their children, and their children’s children; and only a few weeks before her death she sent to the Malays of Sarawak a message of greeting and affection, saying that although it was such a long time since she had seen them, and although she lived so far away, she would never forget them, and hoped that they would not forget her. She need have had no fear. The European community of Kuching in the year of the Ranee Margaret’s arrival consisted of three married couples and five or six bachelors. Communications with the outside world were irregular and uncertain, most of the comforts of civilised life were larking, and amusements were few. The Ranee Margaret, however, instead of lapsing into boredom, made her own amusements, and

Q: What was Her Highness the Ranee Margaret's background before she married His Highness the Rajah? 
A: The Ranee Margaret was born in Paris on October 9th, 1649. She spent her childhood at the Chateau d’Epinay-sur-Orge and later lived in Wiltshire with her parents after their home was sold. In 1869 she first met Sir Charles Brooke (then Mr. Brooke) who was her mother's cousin and two years previously had succeeded Sir James Brooke as second Rajah of Sarawak. The Ranee Margaret and the Rajah were married on October 28th, 1869 after a somewhat unconventional courtship, and a few months later they set sail for Sarawak.

The following morning a crowded day of engagements began with a ceremonial presentation of awards by His Excellency the Governor, who wore uniform. The presentation took place on the padang, which had been decorated with flags and a stand for spectators erected, in the presence of a large gathering of all communities. The Datu Pengiran Haji Matusin from Kuala Lawas attended in full Council Negri uniform. In all 10 awards were presented, including the B.E.M. to Native Officer Bigar, Awak Pengiran. Murut. and Penghulu Lawai. Kelabit, the k.m.c. to 8 Muruts, 1 Kelabits, and 2 Chinese and the Kings Com mendation to 1 Murut. An interesting feature of the ceremony was the presence of a flute band of Muruts under Guru Pantalusang from the Long Semado School which gave a most impressive rendering of the National Anthem. All their instruments had been locally made of bamboo.
Next, after Their Excellencies had been introduced to members of the Lawas District Advisory Council, His Excellency the Governor heard requests in Court. The remainder of the morning was occupied with visits to the hospital, bazaar, and Chinese School where Their Excel- lencies and party were entertained to refreshments.
In the afternoon the party went by outboard to Rumah Itai Lakai at Lawas Damit. There a ceremonial Murat victory dance took place, a file
of women singing and circulating round an ornamental pole at the base of which a huge 20 ft. crocodile had been modelled in clay. To compromise this pagan dance with their Christian religion they had thoughtfully surmounted the pole with a Cross, and it is interesting to note that the “leading lady" was an elderly Murut woman married to a Chinese and called in for the afternoon.
After taking tea with Penghulu Itai Lakai in the house, the party set off back in heavy rain, calling in en route at the Borneo Evangelical Mission, where Mr. and Mrs. H. C. Southwell and members of the Mission also entertained the party to tea.
In the evening a sateh party was held in the Kubu for the recipients of medals and local notables at which Their Excellencies and Mrs. MacDonald circulated amongst the guests. This was followed by a concert on the padang, in which the Malay, Chinese and Long Semado Murut schools per- formed, as well as members of the Government Staff and Lawas Estate. Native Officer Bigar and P.N.O. Johnathan Saban are to be congratulated on the excellence of their arrangements and decorations, and thanks are due to Mr. Maclaren of Lawas Estate for his assistance with regard to the entertainment.
Leaving Lawas early on Saturday morning, the Karina reached Limbang soon after noon. On landing Their Excellencies inspected the Guard of Honour and were introduced to local notables. Their Excellencies and party then proceeded to the Residency for lunch with the Resident and Mrs. Anderson. During the afternoon His Excellency the Governor addressed members of the District Advisory Council in Court. This was followed by a discussion on local Government matters.
After tea His Excellency the Governor and the Private Secretary enjoyed a game of badminton with Native Officer Tuanku Mahdzar and members of his badminton club at his house. Following a reception at the Residency for recipients of awards, members of the District Advisory Council, and other notables, Their Excellencies attended a dis- play of Dayak dancing on the padang in front of the Court House. As at Lawas, the Residency and the Government area at Limbang were decorated after dark with torches.
On Sunday morning His Excellency the Governor held a ceremonial presentation of awards on the padang in front of the Court House. On this occasion 2 B.e.ms., 2 King’s Medals for Courage, and 5 King’s Commendations were presented. Following the presentations Their Excellencies visited the bazaar, Chinese and Malay schools.
The afternoon was occupied by two tea parties, the first at the Chinese Club, and the second at the Persatuan Melayu. On both occasions His Excel- lency the Governor-General replied to speeches of welcome. A very replete party returned to the Residency after these entertainments. In the evening Their Excellencies attended a most enjoy- able concert in which all communities took part.
Their Excellencies and party left Limbang on Monday morning, November 10th, for Brunei, where they were entertained by the Resident, Mr. W. Peel. On Tuesday His Excellency the Governor and the Private Secretary proceeded overland to Miri, lunching en route at Seria with Mr. G. O. Higgins, General Manager of the British Malayan Petroleum Co. Ltd., and being met at Kuala Baram by the Resident, Fourth Division.
Transport from Seria to Miri and for all other movements by road for the period of the tour was very kindly provided by the British Malayan Petroleum Co. Ltd. and Sarawak Oilfields Ltd.

Q: What were some of the events that took place during His Excellency the Governor's visit to Lawas?
A: During His Excellency's visit to Lawas, there was a ceremonial presentation of awards on the padang, where 10 awards including B.E.M., K.M.C., and King’s Commendation were presented. The Governor also visited the hospital, bazaar, Chinese School, and attended a Murat victory dance at Lawas Damit. In the evening, there was a sateh party for recipients of medals and local notables followed by a concert on the padang where Malay, Chinese, and Long Semado Murut schools performed along with members of the Government Staff and Lawas Estate.

Proceedings occupied ten days and Court which was equipped with broadcasting and film apparatus, microphones, loud-speakers, soda-fountains, beer-engines and Turkish baths was crowded. On conclusion of hearing, appeal was allowed. Promulgation of Court’s decision was signal for wild outburst of cheering which could be heard as far as Batu Kawa. Curator on release was escorted to his house by band of Sarawak Rangers and procession seven miles long which had to cleave its way through dense cheering crowds blocking the road.
Lord Rothermere has cabled approval of verdict which his Lordship states drives home once again the folly of laissez faire policy and adherence to outworn dogmas of free trade. This memorable decision said his Lordship drives one more nail into coffin of Baldwin’s leadership.
BRITISH OFFICIAL. -General consternation has been caused by announcement that the four apes which escaped from London Zoo three weeks ago had been discovered on Treasury Bench House of Commons where they had been sitting for some days. Consternation is intensified by fact that these apes transacted important public business during this period and Attorney General is now being consulted as to legality or otherwise of measures which were passed owing to inclusion of apes in Government lobby.
LATER. -It has now been ascertained that apes were introduced to House of Commons by Mr. George Bernard Shaw who states that he considered, them eminently suited to take part in discussion of measures then before the House. Statement of Prime Minister MacDonald that he mistook apes for leading members of Cabinet is generally doubted and conservative organs cite this as one more instance of Labour Leader’s political chicanery. Prime Minister has appointed joint select committee to consider possible extension of franchise to simians within the Empire.
BERLIN. -In Reichstag to-day seven members of National Socialist party were shot dead by communists who had secreted machine-gun on one of the back benches. Nazis retaliated by raiding homes of nineteen communists and burning them alive. President of Reich has intimated disapproval of this breach of courtesy which infringes all accepted rules of debate.
RUGBY. -Colonel Barker has declined Vice royalty of India which has now been offered to “Bugs” Moran.
LONDON. – “Bugs” Moran has refused Vice royalty of India on grounds of insufficient remuneration. “There’s bigger money in the booze racket than in hazing a bunch of Nigs,” cabled Moran, “so it’s the bootleg game for mine. Nix on this deputy King stuff.” Secretary of State for India Benn on receiving cabled refusal evinced great irritation stamping his feet and shouting-“Won’t anyone take the damned job?” After bedside consultation with Prime Minister MacDonald Benn has decided to offer Viceroyalty to Miss Hetta Chzrymp, Europe’s Beauty Queen for 1930 Miss Chzrymp until being crowned Miss Europe was employed as junior stenographer in office of Jugoslavian calomel King.
NEW DELHI. -All-India Synod to-day unanimously applauded appointment of Miss Chzrymp. passing a resolution fervently congratulating Secretary for India Benn on his choice. Speakers included Rev. Chatterjee Jhumabhoy. M.A. (Agra), D.D., Very Rev. K. Ponnish, B.A., D. D.; Right Kev. N. N. Vaiatilingam, D. LITT. (Allahabad), D.D., D.T.M.; Ven. B. N. Ram Dass, B.A.O., D.D.; Rev.

Karuthavaloo, B.A., B.A.O., D.D.
TOKIO. -Daggers, short swords, inkpots. desk lids, name-plates, penknives, pencil-boxes, electric light fittings, hat-racks, road-metal bunches of keys, chairs, table-legs and typewriters ensured a lively session of the Diet yesterday, where deputies freely exchanged blows and bombarded each other with the above-named articles. Bombardment which was well-sustained and accurate concluded forceful argument between members of extreme and centre of Left wing. Baron Heiyosaki centre-forward for Right wing party scored a goal by flattening Mr. Fuyada with heavy typewriter, but Deputy Oshima levelled score by stabbing Right wing’s goal-keeper to death and braining Deputy Suzeida with cuspidor.
Proceedings terminated in disorder. -(REUTER).

Q: What was the outcome of the Court's decision regarding Lord Rothermere?
A: The appeal was allowed, and upon release, the curator was escorted by a band of Sarawak Rangers in a procession seven miles long. Lord Rothermere also cabled his approval of the verdict.

M.V. Doggenbank, a vessel flying the Dutch flag, arrived at Sibu from Singapore during February, and later proceeded to Bintulu.
Another conviction against a member of a Chinese secret society was obtained at Sarikei.
The Acting District Officer, Sarikei, reports that the reconditioning of the concrete wharf is nearing completion, (rood progress has also been made with the construction of the new Government offices The Acting Assistant District Ollicer, Kapit, reports that on the 14th Penghulu Paso and about 30 followers arrived down from Belaga, bringing with them 70 Kayane from Long Nawang, Dutch Borneo. They returned on the 17th, but ten days later another party of 14 Kayans arrived from Long Nawang with Penghulu Jugah. They had come overland from the Ulu Rejang to the Mirirai, the Batang Rejang having been in flood towards the end of the month.
The price of sago continues to be liable to rapid fluctuations throughout the Oya district, but was fairly steady at 55 cents per passu in Sg. Kut at the end of the month, as against a price of only 35 to 40 cents at Mukah. Rumours about the projected factories at the Igan end of the Kut are causing much debate in Dalat Bazaar.
As a result of the dry weather, engkabang has ! started flowering in many rivers in the Kapit district, and a good crop is expected about July. Owing to the fact that felling and farming operations will probably be in full swing about this time, many Dayaks will not be able to take advantage of this.
A Farewell Speech.
The Acting District Officer, Mukah. reports that Penghulu Umpoh of the Ulu Mukah was reprimanded during the month for general slackness, since it is apparent that he is the most useless penghulu in the district.
We print below in full a speech made by Dr. Su Chin Nang at a dinner-party recently given by him at Sibu. Wc understand that Dr. Chin Nang will shortly be visiting China, but we hope that, he will soon return to Sarawak.
Most of the work in connection with the electrification of the Mukah Waterworks was completed by the end of the month. Progress is now held up pending the arrival of a T-piece, but the new pumps should be in action a few days after this has been fitted.
In general, the health of the Oya district was good during the month, but elephantiasis seems to be unduly prevalent among the Melanaus. It is doubtful if anything can be done at present to diminish the incidence of this disease among natives
Many complaints were made to the Assistant District Officer. Oya. during the course of an upriver trip, regarding Ilie embargo on the sale of cartridges. There appears to be a very general bitterness about this rule in the Ulu Oya. since these Dayaks maintain that they have never given any trouble, and that by stopping the supply of cartridges Government has left them defenceless against the pigs anil deer which ravage their crops.
Dayak padi is poor in all districts of the Ulu Oya, much of it having suffered during the exceptional floods last December.
As a result of an election held in Kampong Kekan to choose a successor to T.K. Nyalong, one Gani bin Jemarai was selected, the whole kampong being unanimously in favour of his appointment. This has now been confirmed by His Highness the Rajah. '
Resident, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I have the honour to state that I have been in Sibu for twenty-five years. When 1 was in China, I always heard praisings of the kind and good Government of Sarawak from those who returned from Sibu. I was so much moved bv such praisings that I made up my mind that I should come across the sea. In 1910 I resigned from the service of my mother Hospital, and brought my family to come here. After 1 came to Sibu, I was comforted, as all conditions were just as what I had heard in China. Then, I was engaged to be i hi charge of the Government Hospital at Sibu for a period of seven years, during which time I worked with diligence and carefulness. I resigned from the Government on my own account—1. to start a dispensary. 2. to make rubber gardens. For this I have been quite successful. Since I have been living for a long period of years, I might boast myself that I am not only a good citizen in this country, but also a good help in telling people how to be law-abiding fellows. So we are much pleased to make our home here.
As I am in duty bound to return to China for the burial of my father, who died about 50 years ago, I take this opportunity of my immediate future going home to express my thanks to the Government. First :—1. I have made a good success both in trade and shop building, and in rubber gardens, from which I can get a good support for my family.
2.I have enjoyed much welfare in this country under the kind and good Government here.

Q: What was the reason behind Dr. Su Chin Nang's farewell speech at the dinner party recently given by him at Sibu?
A: Dr. Su Chin Nang gave a farewell speech at the dinner party because he was about to visit China, but it is hoped that he would return to Sarawak soon. The speech allowed Dr. Su Chin Nang to express his gratitude and share his experiences living in Sibu for 25 years and how he found the conditions there as per what he had heard from those who returned from Sibu while he was still in China.

Sarawak Gazette. KUCHING, Friday, August. 1st, 1930. Suara Sarawak. July. His Highness the Tuan Muda paid a visit to Miri, with Mr. Boult the Chief Secretary, leaving Kuching by H.H.M.Y. Maimuna on July 16th and returning on the 21st. Miss Valerie Brooke, daughter of the Ranee of Sarawak, was one of those who took part on July 1st in a delightful children's performance at the New Scala Theatre, in aid of the Princess Louise Kensington Hospital for Children. On July 4th Kuching welcomed the two flying boats (which paid us a visit in June), on their return from British North Borneo. They reached Mukah on the 1st instant via Miri and Bintulu, and proceeded to Kuching, after paying a visit to Sibu on the 2nd. His Highness the Tuan Muda flew as a passenger from Pending and alighted in the river just opposite the Astana, where the public had a convenient opportunity of inspecting the interesting craft. A cable from Sandakan announces the birth of a son to Mrs. A. F. Richards, the wife of Mr. A. F. Richards, the Governor of British North Borneo. Congratulations to them. Mr. N. E. Hughes paid a short visit to Singapore, in connection with the arrangements for the forthcoming visit of His Excellency the British Agent for Sarawak and British North Borneo, leaving Kuching on July 6th and returning on the 14th. A short provisional programme of the visit will be found elsewhere in our issue. On Wednesday, July 16th a most successful At Home was given by St. Mary's School, on the occasion of their annual sports. They were favoured with fine weather, and the afternoon passed all too quickly to the interested friends who were present. A listof the items and results is given on a later page.
Mr. P. Cobbold of the Borneo Company, Limited, in Sibu, arrived on a visit to Kuching on July 16th.
Never in its history, we imagine, has the Prefecture Apostolic of Sarawak known so great a gathering of clergy and nuns as occurred this month during the Annual Retreat held in Kuching, presided over by Mgr. A. Wachter, the Superior of North Borneo. In addition to the local Mission and Convent staff, the visitors were :â€”Mgr. A. Wachter, North Borneo; Very Rev. H. Jansen,  Miri; Rev. A. Klerk, Kanowit; Rev. V. Halder, Sibu; Rev. A. Mulder, Mukah; Rev. W. van Odyk, Durin; Rev. L. Vanden Bergh, Binatang; Rev. J. Staal, Sadong, and Rev. C. Epping, Dalat and Oya.
Sisters were:â€”Mother Mary and Sister Clotilda, Kanowit; Mother Peter and Sister Dorothea, Sibu; Mother Clare, Dalat and Oya; Mother Alphonsus and Sister Lucilla, Mukah.
We hear that during the great thunder-storm which occurred at Kuching on July 28th, the Convent came in for an unexpected share in the programme, receiving some damage which might have had more serious results for Mother Clare of Oya. The injury caused to Mother Clare's foot necessitated an amputation of a toe, but we are glad to learn that the patient is progressing satisfactorily.
On July 23rd the King and Queen of England greeted three hundred Bishops, at Buckingham Palace, during their presence in London for the Lambeth Conference. It will be interesting to have the impressions of the Right Reverend Bishop Danson on this great assembly, when he returns towards the close of the year.
The Bishop of Singapore, the Right Rev. B. C. Roberts, who has been attending the Lambeth Conference in London, is now on his way back to Singapore in the P. and O. s.s. Mantua, due in Singapore on August 7th.
Programmes are out for the St. Thomas' School Concert on July 29th and 30th. The programme of ten items promises well. The profits will be devoted to a fund for starting a School Magazine.
The revised Handbook to the State of North Borneo, has just been published by the British North Borneo (Chartered) Co., and is sold at 2/. There are 14 chapters dealing with the following which are of particular interest: History, Geography, Population, Climate, etc., Natural and Forest Products, Agriculture, Timber, Geology and Minerals, Sports and Natural History, Administration, Principal Towns, Communications, Opening for Capitalists and Settlers, and General Information.
There is a copious supplement of 30 pages giving statistical and other information, and a very excellent map, besides some good photographs.
We learn from Third Division reports that 180 crocodiles have been brought in during the month of June, for the usual rewards. A comparative crocodile return from the various divisions, during the past few years, would be of interest.
The Rock Road Steeplechase course was dismantled about the middle of the month. The list of winners does not seem to have reached us!

Q: Who paid a visit to Miri along with Mr. Boult the Chief Secretary on July 16th, 1930?
A: His Highness the Tuan Muda visited Miri along with Mr. Boult the Chief Secretary on July 16th.

It appears, therefore, that "santubong" is an original Iban word as the Malays don't use that word.
It would be interesting if anyone can explain whether the Iban meaning of “santubong" has anything to do with the locality at all.
Yours faithfully,

Miri Letter
When things are done in Miri they are usually done by highly capitalized and highly mechanized media; the hole in the road, if repaired at all, is repaired by monsters recalling the megatheria of the past, the changkol and earth basket are replaced by grabs and trucks of fantastic proportions, so that man all but dis-appears from the scene of operations. It is therefore gratifying to find a good example of community effort on a primitive scale, and this is afforded by the work on the new Malay school. The building reached a certain stage and then ceased for lack of funds. It was decided to continue the work by popular effort, and for the last few Sundays the derelict building site has been transformed into a hive of industry from seven to ten in the morning. Not merely the young and the whole have come along to work, but the aged and the infirm also, and much edification has been given by the pre-dominance of the latter. It is hoped that by the end of the year the central block will be ready for use.
Schools are much in the air at the present time. The Resident has just opened the new school which the Temonggong has built for the R.C. Mission at Long San, and this is a whole series of buildings in the grand manner, which lacks only a statue of the founder in the quadrangle to compare with the more ancient institu-tions in Europe.
In Marudi it is merely a question of time before there is a great efflorescence of building, for each member of the Chung Hua School committee now buys a ticket of the Turf Club's Unlimited Sweep on behalf

of the building fund. Even the fowls of the air are involved, for the swallows of Long Lamah, apart alto-gether from constructing diverse nests for their own accommodation, have built an excellent Chinese school, it is hoped to direct the attention of these industrious birds to the needs of the Local Authority school there also.
The Baram is now entering on its Palladian era. The Temonggong has made Long San the Chatsworth of the Division; his spacious chambers decorated by artists from Indonesia are quite without peer in the country. Elsewhere there has been much building and embellishment; Penghulu Gau has started work on the new structure which will make Long Ikang a house of monumental proportions.
Ever since Mr. Morton of the Borneo Evangelical Mission took to flitting about in his plane the Fourth Division has become very air-conscious. Penghulu Tama Bulan Lian at Lio Matu possesses the best air strip in the country. Penghulu Lawai Besara has at Bario one that can meet all requirements. Penghulu Tama Paya Anyi's at Long Atip has one slight draw-back, a "thus far and no further" hillock at the end of the runway.
At first it was thought that the possession of an air strip carried with it certain theological implications, but when the District Officer at Marudi recently started to construct one, it was apparent that this was not the case. The Temonggong is now surveying one at Long San and the other penghulus are taking similar steps. On the analogy of Long Tebangan even the more thrus-ting Tuah Kampong are developing similar ambitions. Time was when every penghulu must possess a school as part of the insignia of office, but now an air strip is the badge of authority. It is believed that next year it will be necessary to introduce legislation restraining any below the rank of Penghulu from constructing air strips or other aeronautical installations without licence of the Resident.
I recently purchased a very nice perahu from the Ka-yans at Long Panai; this was for use in Miri, as a perahu that works is better than even the most modern ferries which do not. I subsequently towed the perahu down to Long Teru, and that night someone came up to the house at about ten o'clock and reported that the perahu had vanished. Penghulu Lawai thought it had certainly been stolen, for he said that there had been a spate of thefts recently. Several of us therefore set out in pursuit, but no trace of the perahu could we find. The following day I met Penghulu Enteri who related that he had purchased a fine perahu for one hundred dollars, that he had tied it up at Long Teru, and that he had never set eyes on it since. In the bazaar the towkeys sympathized with my loss but related instances to show that Long Teru was a perfect Chicago for crime and violence. It was all very distressing, and I was much relieved to find the perahu down in the Baram trapped under a large floating batang. I doubt whe-ther there has been anything comparable since the Crime Wave at Blandings.

Q: What is the significance of air strips in the Fourth Division?
A: Air strips have become a badge of authority among penghulus in the Fourth Division. It indicates that they are keeping up with modern advancements, similar to how possessing a school was considered an insignia of office in the past. The construction of air strips also shows their ambition and willingness to develop their areas for better transportation facilities.

   Trawler Fishing off Malaya.
   
        EXPERIMENTAL VESSEL DUE SOON.
  The fisheries vessel, which has been specially built 
for the Straits Settlements Government at Middles-
brough, England, and which will test the possibi- 
lilies of modern methods of power fishing in local
waters, is due to arrive at Singapore within the next
few days, says the Straits Times.
  The new vessel is a coal-burning trawler of the 
Castle type, familiar to all who have visited East 
Coast fishing ports in England, and it will be in 
charge of three Lowestoft fishermen and a crew of 
Hylams of the type found on the tongkangs engaged 
in the timber carrying trade between Singapore and
the neighbouring islands. The trawler, which has
been named the "Tongkol” (tunnyfish) will be able
to do 3000 miles without putting into port.
  The arrangements for marketing the catches are 
already complete. First of all it will be washed and
part of it will be gutted. It will then be packed on 
ice in the usual trawler fashion in the hold, which
will be kept at the proper temperature by a refri-
gerating plant. It is thus hoped to reproduce, as
far as possible, the conditions at Home, where fish
is kept for weeks without deterioration.
  On its return to Singapore the “Tongkol” will tie
up in the Empire Dock, and the catch will be packed
in boxes with ice and conveyed by lorry to a special
cold storage room provided by the Singapore Cold
Storage Company. From this store a quantity of
fish, probably about a ton, will be removed every
morning and sold by auction in the Clyde Terrace
or Ellenborough markets. The greatest care will be
taken to release the fish judiciously, so as to avoid
interference with market conditions.
  It may be added that the auctions at which local
retailers obtain their fish supplies are conducted by
the Municipality under a system which works very
successfully, and the Government contribution to
local fish supplies, small though it will be, will thus
have to take its chance with the rest.
MODERN EQUIPMENT.
  Although it is hoped to make the trawler pay its
way as far as possible, that factor will not be allowed
to interfere with its experimental work, and the
vessel will not confine itself to any rich fishing
grounds which may be discovered but will explore
new areas. All the information obtained will be at
the disposal of the public, and if the results are
satisfactory it is hoped that local capital will be
attracted, and a fishing industry run on modern
lines begun here.
  The most important methods of power fishing are
the trawl, the Danish seine, the American purse net,
and the drift-net, and the experimental vessel is re-
quired for all these types except the last, for which
it is not altogether suitable.
       A Novel Golf Problem.
  A writer in a Home paper says :—
  Here is a problem on which the St. Andrew’s authorities would pronounce no judgment. A player hit his ball into a grass pot bunker, the bottom of which was very soft owing to recent rain. He took his niblick and played his shot, with the result that fie removed a large lump of soft turf. This remained on his club and the ball remained embedded in the lump of turf. So the player was left, after completing his stroke, with a large divot, containing his ball, firmly adhering to the face of his club.
    What was he to do? The R. and A. Rules Committee could not say.
     [Doomp th’ lot in t’hole?—ED.]	
Six hit with one bullet.
  Six men were wounded by a single bullet on the target range of the “Sixth-fifty” Infantry at San Juan (Porto Rico), says Reuter, when a rifle which was being cleaned by a soldier was accidentally discharged.
  The bullet wounded one private, struck another on the right knee, was deflected from a rifle and hit a third in the neck, then struck a captain and lieutenant in turn, and finally lodged in the hip of a fourth private.

The Failure of Prohibition.
WASHINGTON, APRIL 8.
   The Senate prohibition hearing was continued to-
day, when Mr. George Brennan, the Democratic
political leader of Chicago, declared that the prohi-
bition law was a national scandal and increased
drunkenness, immorality, corruption, murder, in-
sanity, blindness, and crime in general. “The
sensible and honest thing to do,” he added, “is to
modify or repeal this unenforceable statute.”
   “Crime wave after crime wave,” he said, “in one
city after another has occurred.” Thousands have
been killed, blinded, or crazed by the various concoc-
tions sold under counterfeit labels as genuine liquor.
All human experience proves the futility of attempt-
ing to regulate morals by statutes.”	
   Mr. Anton Cermak, President of the Cook Country
Board of Commissions, giving evidence regarding
conditions in Chicago, said there were 2,266 alco-
holic patients in the county hospital compared with

Q: What type of fishing methods will be tested by the "Tongkol," the experimental fisheries vessel built for the Straits Settlements Government?
A: The most important methods of power fishing that will be tested by the "Tongkol" include the trawl, the Danish seine, and the American purse net.

Again my apologies to Mr. Harrisson.
Yours faithully,
E. R. Leach.
[This letter, at Mr. Leach’s request, was shown to Mr. Harrisson whose reply appears below.—Ed.]
Sarawak Museum and Library, Kuching, 22nd August, 1947.
Sir,
Mr. Leach need not apologise to me. His letter is, I am sure, inspired by a proper concern for scientific accuracy. Same here. I am sorry if he is “completely at a loss" to understand “group revitalisation." I used this rather clumsy term (see Webster or other dictionaries) as the nearest I could get for the purpose of a brief summary appearing inside another Gazette article on the much more important matter of H.E.’s Bau tour.
On my short visit accompanying H.E., I could not hope to learn much either of Nubong or Land Dayak. That is why my note stressed “doubt and disagreement" among informants, that "it is difficult to piece together the bits and pieces of these major rituals" to-day, and that “the result was somewhat chaotic." I wished thus to avoid being dogmatic or hasty. What I could do was to compare what I saw and heard with what I had seen and heard much more fully elsewhere in Borneo, and these were the “comparative pheno-
mena" I had in mind. I regret that there was anything puzzling about this normal piece of scientific procedure, particularly as I emphasised : "There is no space to go into detail here; I hope to do so, drawing comparisons with Kelabit and Dutch Kenyah rites, in the first issue of the Sarawak Museum Journal." That, sir, still seems to me the best place for a technical account.
Mr. Leach delightfully refers to my sense of the dramatic. Many Sarawak ceremonies, especially those related to head-hunting, are inspired by just that sense; to understand their meaning it is not always enough to stand puzzled on the sideline with an interpreter, thumbing the form-book for comparative phenomena. An over-developed sense of the academic can be equally inadequate.
I hope, Sir, that I may have settled Mr. Leach’s laudable anxieties. Now, may I in turn query some of his own remarks. If I do so at greater length, it is because I wish to be constructive, as well as to avoid laying myself open to a second charge of haste because I had to say something briefly. Also the subject (heads) has intrinsic interest.
For, having polished off my head, Mr. Leach goes on to make some generalisations on his own, which raise wider issues. He is a visiting expert, and no doubt a very good one. I have certainly given him every possible assistance myself. Indeed, all experts who come among us for specialist or planning studies deserve our fullest sympathy, over and above any direct duty to assist as government servants, etc. At the same time, we need to strike a happy medium between the idea (unfortunately still widespread) that experts are a waste of money and the idea that experts are all-knowing. And the expert himself must guard against the seduct- ions of the latter view. An expert who arrives with preconceived theories or reaches hasty con- clusions can do as much harm as good.
These remarks are not aimed at Mr. Leach personally. I am sure he will do good. I also know he will be in sympathy with me il I examine his own generalisations from this angle, however.
First, then, is he satisfied that his own inform- ation on Nubong, etc., is any better “considered” than mine? Is he sure of the “scientific accuracy" of information obtained on a lightening visit to a people with whom he had no direct method of com- munication? I think anyone who has seriously tried to study the native peoples of Sarawak would agree that it takes a long time before some of them will take you into their confidence about beliefs and rites, and that a great deal of checking is required to insure the accuracy of information received. In the case of Land Dayaks especially—and in connection with the extinct processes of head- hunting most of all—adat is now so obscured and forgotten that among the elders themselves essential facts are forgotten.
Moreover, in Sarawak the degree of local variation may be large, and a wide range of obser- vation is desirable before wide generalisation. 1 cannot help doubting if Mr. Leach, in the month between his arrival and his letter—(much of it spent in Kuching or in travelling) can have learned a lot of the matters he writes about. I also venture to doubt if he has had time to become acquainted with the large written literature of the subject, important in this case since it is only in the earlier accounts that we can hope to find descriptions of
what did actually happen in head-hunting days (and the basis of many rites was, of course, a fresh head).

Q: What concerns or issues does Mr. Harrisson have with Mr. Leach's letter?
A: The author is concerned about the accuracy of information provided by Mr. Leach regarding Nubong and Land Dayak rituals, as he believes that it takes a long time to gain the trust of these communities and ensure accurate information. Additionally, the author questions if Mr. Leach has had enough time in Sarawak to observe and learn about local variations and consult with the written literature on the subject matter.

that "No person shall put in any running stream, navigable river or estuary any tuba root, explosive or any substance which has the affect of stupefying, stunning or poisoning fish.” That such an order was badly needed is proved by the fact that the ulus of many rivers have been almost entirely denuded of fish as the result of ruinous use of tuba on the part of Dayaks and other natives. The natives themselves are by no means blind to the stupidity of this policy of wholesale and wanton destruction, but as things stand at present they are unable to stop it. It is the usual case of "devil take the hindermost;" the inhabitants of each village use the argument that if they do not tuba all the neighbouring streams, somebody else will, and so the merry game goes on. Groups of two or three long-houses combine to tuba certain reaches of rivers at frequent intervals, and often enough they have to hurry to avoid clashing with rival groups. The disastrous results of this senseless competition are only too apparent, and in many cases the natives have stated that they would definitely favour any action which would put an end to the evils of the present system. Owing to the impossibility of their reaching any agreement among themselves, however, there was no hope of them exercising any control on their own initiative, so Government intervention became inevitable. Various ways and means of instituting some sort of effective control were discussed, but after full consideration it was decided that nothing but complete prohibition would meet the case. Six months will elapse, however, before this prohibition comes into force, and during this period Administrative Officers have been asked to give the widest possible publicity to the matter, and to take steps to ensure that the people concerned understand the objects of prohibition Although there will naturally bo some complaints at first , al any rate from Dayaks, it is probable that the grumblers will soon be silenced by results. A year or two ago tuba fishing was prohibited throughout the ulu Ai by a local order. This measure was hailed with a sigh of relief by many of the Dayaks themselves, and the experiment proved completely successful, since the stocking of the rivers responded al once, and after few months fish became plentiful; instead of obtaining meagre catclaw every few weeks, the Dayaks only had to go out with a jala for half-of-an-hour or so to catch enough fish to feed their families. It will bo interesting to see whether the general prohibition of tuba fishing will produce the same results elsewhere in the country, though there is little doubt that this will be the case. It is hoped, also, that once the natives realise the eventual benefits that will result from prohibition, they will give it their support and co-operation as they did in the ulu Ai. Certainly they should in time be grateful for a measure designed to assist the conservation and rational exploitation of a potentially valuable food supply. حال ممليهراكناايكن٢ دارت تݢهن منوبا ايك. فد سهاريبولن جولي 1936 توبا منوبا ايكن اكن  منجادي ساتو تݢهن ددالم نݢري مسراواق كران کتيک ايت اكن دتربيت ساتوءاونداڠ٢ يڠ مڽاتكن دماکين "تياد سياف٢ فون دبنرکن مناره کدالم سبارڠ سوڠي بسر اتو كچيل اتو دمورا سوڠي ياءيت اكر توبا, لتوفن, اتو سبارڠ جوا بندا يڠ ممباوا كبودوهن, مڠجوتکن، اتو مراچونکن ايکن " اداله کواجيفنڽ منربيتکن اوندڠ٢ سفرت اين اوله سبب كڽتاءن يڠ سبنرڽ ياءيت كباڽقکن داولو سوڠي٢ تله سام سلكالي ليچبي تياد برايكن درسبب تركناً راچون توبا اوله اورڠ٢ داياء دان انق٢ نݢري. بومي فترا تىتوله مليهتكن كاءداءن يڠامة كبودوهن داءتس فربواتن يڠ ممبوروڠكن دان سڠاج مروسقكن كهيدوفن ديري سنديري دالم ايتفون هڠݢ سكارڠ ماسيه جوا تياد ماهو دبرهنتيث

Q: What was the reason behind prohibiting tuba fishing in certain rivers?
A: The prohibition was implemented due to the senseless competition among natives that led to almost complete denudation of fish from many rivers as a result of excessive use of tuba. This measure aimed at conserving and rationally exploiting a potentially valuable food supply for future benefits, similar to the successful local order in ulu Ai where prohibition resulted in increased fish stock and abundance.

Second Division News.
May.
Mr. II. E. Cutfield, Acting Resident. Second Division, visited Bantu, Ulu Lingga. on May 22nd, and reports that the new bazaar is nearing completion. and that the pepper in this district looks particularly healthy.
The Assistant District Officer, Simanggang, visited the Skrang from May 7th to 27th No signs indicating the presence of outlaws were encountered, although rumours were current that some of them were continually passing backwards and forwards between R. Kemnt. Ulu Menjuau. and R. Manchu, Ulu Lemanak. Some of the people in R. Kemal are related to the outlaw Jeluing.
On May 12th. a case of arson was reported at Engkilili. which resulted in the arrest of a Chinese named Lai Fah. Tie was Inter convicted in the Resident's Court under section 43S of the Penal Code, but judgment was reserved since it appeared that he was insane and not responsible for his actions.
The Pusa Malays report a disappointing fishing season.
The padi-harvest in the Saribas district is said io he the worst for many years, and there is little doubt that there will soon be a shortage. Already large quantities of rice have been purchased in the bazaar, and as a result the price has risen sharply.
The Acting District Officer, Saribas. reports that the road between Belong and Simanggang is in ven bad condition after the first five miles, am! after Pengkalan Jongkong becomes practically impassable for anyone carrying a load.
On May 26th, St. Augustine's Day. the S.P.G. Mission at Belong held a land sports meeting. The entries were numerous, and several local records were broken. Both the competitors and a large crowd of spectators spent a most enjoyable afternoon, at the conclusion of which the Acting District Officer presented the prizes. In the evening. Form prizes were presented, and the proceedings were wound up by exhibitions of various types of dances in which both parents and boys took part.
Three Foochows were arrested at Saratok on suspicion of being members of the Sarikei secret society which was recently broken up.
A diving contest was held at Saratok on May 27th to settle a land dispute. Both the contestants remained under water for more than five minutes.
Mr. G. R. U. Arundell. Travelling Assistant District Officer. Lubok Antu, reports with great regret the death, on May 24th, after a lingering illness. of ex-Penghulu Baro of the Lower Delok. Ex-Penghulu Baro served the Government faithfully for sixteen years and retired on pension on account of old age in November. 1932. his place being taken by his son Jimbun.
Ex-Penghulu Baro s death was followed by some most interesting ceremonial rites, which are only performed on the death of a celebrated warrior such as Baro. The body remained in the king-house for three days, during which time a ‘wake" was held, relatives and friends watching and wailing over it, and numerous firearms being discharged and votive offering displayed. The body was then placed in a coffin and taken about 100 yards from the house, where it remained for a further period of four days, after which it was earned to its final resting-place on a certain hill which had been chosen by the ex-Penghulu during his lifetime. Henceforth this hill will be declared mail, and will remain a Di’saka ulit.
On May 30th, Mr. Arundell, accompanied by twelve police and eleven levies, left on a surprise trip to Ulu Batang Ai with the intention of arresting any outlaws who might be found hiding in the uninhabited stretches of this area.
SIMANGGANG NEWS REEL.
The King’s Birthday week-end was enlivened by the very welcome visit of Mr. Calvert from Kuching, and Messrs. Barcroft and White from Belong and Saratok respectively.
The main object of the visit was. to discuss the Tapping Holiday and the Rubber Census, but advantage was taken of the opportunity for holding a football competition at the same time, seven teams being entered.
The weather, which had held splendidly until Friday evening, suddenly broke down, and the pitch, never very dry at the best of limes, unfortunately became, a morass. This reacted unfavourably on the outstation teams, for Betong, who met the Clerks in the first round, showed us in the first half wane of the prettiest football seen in Simanggang for a long time. In the second half, however, the ground proved too much for them and the Clerks picking up a two goal deficit forced a draw. The replay on the Sunday morning saw Betong defeated by the odd goal in three—two very interesting games.
The police disposed of the Saratok and Ulu Ai sides quite comfortably, but the Clerks, a very leg- weary team after having had two barn games against Betong. found the kick and rush methods of Juragan Jais team rather strenuous, and only just got home by one goal to nil.
The Police and Clerks met in the final on Monday evening, and a rather "towsy” game resulted in a draw of two goals each on replay the following Saturday the Clerks won by two goals to one.

Q: What were some of the events that took place during Mr. Arundell's visit in Simanggang?
A: During Mr. Arundell's visit in Simanggang, there was a football competition held with seven teams participating. The King’s Birthday week-end was also enlivened by the visits of Mr. Calvert from Kuching and Messrs. Barcroft and White from Belong and Saratok respectively to discuss the Tapping Holiday and Rubber Census. Additionally, a land sports meeting at St. Augustine's Day was held where local records were broken and prizes were presented for both competitions and formals.

we went boating in the West Lake, and visited all the places of interest in this lake. There are many pleasure boats for hire, some paddled by the fair sex, but the majority by men who make if their profession. All boats arc licensed, the fee being $10 a year, and numbered. Not being a writer, as 1 have already mentioned, I am unable to describe, to my great regret, the beautiful scenery of this famous lake; the lake is natural, but many parts have been bridged and some alterations have been made to add to its natural beauty. Writings of famous ancient men can be seen everywhere. The gentle fragrant breeze and the ripple of the crystal water of the shallow lake makes existence in this drab world seems worth while for the time being, and the gorgeous natural scenery on which our eyes feasted with undiminishing pleasure is balm for the con¬ flict of daily life. Everything there has a legend or a history attached to it, and your guide will explain to you any questions you may wish to ask him. The guide is supposed to be supplied by the hotel, but his transport is defrayed by the visitor; and of course he expects a tip. The Chung San public park, The Liu Villa, The Kok Village and the town itself face the lake, which is so wide that a boat will take a whole day to circumnavigate it. On the 12th at 8 a.m. we went out to see the Museum, which was opened at 9 a.m. This museum includes a zoo and a forest experimental plantation. and minerals and other ancient articles are also to be found there. Some curiosities like a sheep with two bodies, eight feet, but only one head, and a mummified corpse, excavated during road-making and kept in a glass receptacle, are among the many exhibits in the museum. Live specimens of plants with their botanical names in Latin and Chinese may be seen in the compound. From here we went to the centre of the town where business is fairly brisk. Talking of business, the selling of young deer-horns is most interesting. A herd of deers of about 100 head is kept in a large shop-house, and their young horns while still soft are trimmed off for sale at good price. These deer are small and spotted, not like the big deer in this country. Each is kept in its own enclosure, the inside of which is far from clean. Hang Chow is a model town, and sanitation is well observed by the pedestrians so far as one could see. Smoking in public is forbidden, and we were politely approached by a policeman on duty and asked not to smoke in the street. Spitting is not tolerated at all, and pedestrians will have to see that their coats are properly buttoned. All these things are only forbidden on the public roads, and anyone who wishes to smoke cigarettes can enjoy them to his heart’s content in bis own house or in the shops. BACK TO SHANGHAI. At 1.0 p.m. we came to the station, after having our return tickets "chopped” we went to the plat¬ form to wait for the train for Shanghai. Leaving Hang Chow at 2.0 p.m., we arrived at Shanghai at 7.0 p.m. that evening. Dinner over, we spent our time in reading the newspapers, from which wo learnt about the passenger air service in China, and decided to fly to Nanking. On the 13th, we filled in and signed declaration forms for purchasing our air tickets from Shanghai to Nanking at $25 each. We sent, our luggage by train to Nanking. In the afternoon we spent our time in motor-car rides, sight-seeing in the town, and also went to the museum which, we were informed, was not yet completed and was therefore shut to the public. We went to the famous Shanghai Stadium, but the entrances were closed, so we only had an outside view. We then went to see Mr. Wang’s private park, this park, though private property, and a part of the compound of (he residency of Mr. Wang, is open to the general public. There arc many things to see in here, in fact it is far better and contains more things of interest than the Chung San Park in Hang Chow. We visited the Great World at night Unlike its namesake in Singapore, this Great World com- prises houses several storeys high. There is little to see here, but there was a wayang in every other room. From here we went to the cinema hall, where a fairly good talky was being shown to a large and appreciative audience. To NANKING BY AIR. On the 14th we got up at 5 a.m., rang for our breakfast, which we swallowed rather in a hurry, and picking some odds and ends of our stuffs, we drove to the Lung Hua Aerodrome, where we arrived at 6.15 a.m. Though we were early some passengers had already arrived there before us. Those who were so unlucky as to be too fat were weighed, although the passenger’s weight was declared in the prescribed form. By 6.55 a.m. the gate to the aerodrome was opened and we all were shepherded      into      the        aeroplane    "Cheng     Tu,"    and we took our seats by the side of each other. This aeroplane is a 14-seater, and there were eleven passengers in all including three ladies, one of whom was a Chinese. The engine started

Q: What are some activities that can be done around West Lake in Hangzhou?
A: Activities around West Lake include boating, visiting places of interest such as Chung San public park, Liu Villa, Kok Village, and the town itself which face the lake. Additionally, one can visit the Museum which includes a zoo and a forest experimental plantation, and see live specimens of plants with their botanical names in Latin and Chinese.

  MR.W.Cotterill left on 11th December in H.H.M.Y.Maimuna for duty at Miri and Limbang.We understand that he will be away for about two months.Mr.A.Macpherson,Cadet,left by the same vessel for duty at Limbang.
  MR.E.Banks,Curator of the Sarawak Museum,recently left for Ceylon to recuperate after a stiff attack of typhoid.We wish him a pleasant trip and renewed health.
  WE are asked to call the attention of all concerned to the notice in the Government Gazette to the effect that medical practitioners in Sarawak are required to renew thier licences annually as from the first day of each year.We believe that the penalty for non-compliance has some connection with boiling oil,but we are not certain on that point.
  WIRELESS Stations were opened for traffic at Tatau and Balingian on 14th and 18th December,respectively.
  WE are asked to announce that a woollen sweater,left in one of the Sarawak Steamship Company's vessels,has been lying in the Sibu Office of that Company for about a year,and that the owner may recover the article on application.We are not informed as to whether the Company intends to make any charges for rent,commission or demurrage,or not.
  "All the small holders in Saribas have been instructed and stencils given to them,and in future no more unmarked rubber will be shipped from here.All the rubber dealers have been warned to get rid of any unmarked rubber they may have.One trader at each of the following places: Betong,Spaoh and Saratok was fined 10 each for failing to keep a record book,showing the name and kampong of the person from whom they had bought their rubber.At Debak two rubber dealers were fined.Another three Chinese traders at Spaoh have just been summoned and as they have been told repeatedly to keep a record and a fine of 10 does not seem to have any effect on them at all,they will be dealt with more severely this time.
  "Eighteen smoke houses altogether have been erected by Native rubber planters in Saribas and undoubtedly as time goes on many more will be built.At Debak there is only one smoke house and it has just been reported to me that no use is being made of it,as the traders there,all having smoke houses of their own,refuse to give a better price for smoked sheets.
   "I personally visited many Dyak houses and everywhere found them very keen to improve the quality of their rubber.Where as some time ago many of them did not possess rubber mangles,there is at present hardly anyone who has not got one.The sale of mangles,sieves,etc.,at Betong for the month of November amounts to over seven hundred dollars,which alone proves that they take an interest in what we are doing for them.An all round improvement in the quality of the rubber is distinctly noticeable and the traders all admit that in most cases nothing more can be done to turn out better sheets.
   "On taking a look at the rubber in the Kalaka bazaars,where so far only about half of the gardens have been visited,the diference when comparing a marked sheet with an unmarked one,is remarkable.In Kalaka there are many houses that have no mangles at all,but they are nearly all willing to buy them.Up to now only two smoke houses have been erected in the Krian.Many Dyaks are interested in it though,and about six of them have already promised to build smoke houses."-[Extract from Report.]
   WE congratulate the Rubber Exports Improvement Fund on the success which is attending its efforts and are very glad to note that,in due course,its attentions are to be turned towards the pepper industry.We hope that similar success may reward its labours in that field,which,we think,is of no less importance than the former.
   DRY rubber harvested at Sungei Tengah Estates during the months of October and November was approximately 180,000 lbs.
   MEMBERS of the Malayan Amateur Wireless Society,says the Singapore Free Press,will be interested to hear that Capt.Benfield of the s.s.Kuchinq recently picked up a concert broadcasted from Singapore when 150 miles out at sea.The reception was remarkably clear.
   THE Government Offices were closed on Christmas day and on Monday,the latter being Bank Holiday.

Q: What is the news about Mr. W. Cotterill and Mr. A. Macpherson in The Sarawak Gazette dated January 3, 1927?
A: In the Sarawak Gazette dated January 3, 1927, it was reported that Mr. W. Cotterill left for duty at Miri and Limbang on December 11th and would be away for about two months. He traveled by H.H.M.Y. Maimuna along with Cadet Mr. A. Macpherson who also left for duty at Limbang.

One ease of typhoid was reported in Miri on May 8th. No further cases had come to light by the middle of June.
The following is an extract from the May report of the District Officer, Miri : "On my visit to Niah and Suai the question of farming land pre- dominated. The Dayaks are everywhere eni roach- ing on Malay and Kedayan land. Whereas formerly the aim of the Dayaks was to get up the ulu as far as possible, they now tend to move to the richer down-river areas. Some "borrow" land from Kedayans and refuse to return it. The Suai river is comparatively sparsely inhabited and naturally offers great attractions to land hungry Dayaks. There appear to be large areas of swamp land but expert agricultural advice will be necessary to ascertain its padi possibilities."
The District Officer, Miri, reports that through- out the visit referred to in the preceding paragraph every opportunity was taken to discuss Cession. In no case was any dissentient voice raised. The people were merely concerned with the perentah.
The District Officer, Miri, reports that while at, Niah he visited the caves in connection with guano. The present method of abstraction, he says, is laborious and uncertain. Casual Dayak labour at piece-work rates has to be relied Bn. The present "monopoly holder" pays Government $350 per month and still makes a profit. It is unlikely. however, that he will put up capital for "improved abstractions facilities." The District Officer points out that the possibility of modern methods inter- fering with the birds breeding must also be kept in view.
A meeting of all shop-keepers in Miri was held in the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in May, and the question of the re-building of Miri Bazaar was discussed. Government proposals were explained and counter-proposals considered. The traders, says the District Officer, have put forward a rough plan of the design of shop-house which would be most popular.
The District Officer, Miri. reports that on May 23rd Sarawak Oilfieds Limited successfully launched a new sea line at Lutong. "It is under- stood the usual ceremony on the occasion of splicing the main brace was duly performed."
As a result of a meeting with all pork butchers in Miri the price of pork was to be reduced as from June 1st. The middleman has now been cut out, the District Officer says, and pigs from Kuching have been put on a quota basis.
In May the Dayak chiefs of the Baram District reported that their anak biak were so disheartened by the falling price of rubber that they were looking for other work.
The District Officer. Bintulu, reports that padi was, in May, being brought in great quantities for sale to Government at Tatau, Sebauh, and Bintulu. Over 3,(XX) piculs were awaiting ship- ment at the end of the month.
FIFTH DIVISION.
The Honourable the Resident reports that the facilities of Brunei Hospital are now open to the Division and it is hoped that all races will take advantage of it.
Preliminary discussions have taken place with regard to the re-building of Limbang Bazaar. The general opinion appears to be that the present temporary bazaar cannot last longer than two more years. Land and shop owners seem to favour re-building on the present site while tenants prefer to move.
Officers who have served in the Fifth Division and ex-internees will both be delighted to hear that on June 23rd Mr. J. S. Maclaren was married by civil ceremony in Lawas to Dr. Eva Cairns, late of Stirling. Scotland.
The District Officer, Limbang, reports that four prisoners, convicted of murder, arrived in Limbang in June "on their way to Kuching for execution." The Honourable the Resident comments that it would be more correct to say that they "were proceeding to Kuching to facilitate their desire to appeal to the Supreme Court, pending ratification or revision of their sentences." The convictions of these men were eventually quashed on appeal.
The Honourable the Resident reports that it has been noted that "quite a few children" of Merapok, Lawas, attend a school at Mengalong, across the North Borneo border. Mengalong is only a short distance from Merapok.
Address of Colonial Office.
The following announcement has been issued by the Secretariat: —
“It is notified for general information that, with effect from the 31st of August, 1947. the official address of the Colonial Office will be Church House, Great Smith Street, London, S.W.l."

The Editor, Sarawak Gazette, Kuching.
Dear Sir,
On page 131 of the Sarawak Gazette for July 2nd, 1947. you quote a report from the District Officer, Saribas, with regard to cotton production in the Second Division.
I consider there is some risk that this report may raise extravagant hopes with regard to the possibil- ities of cotton growing in Sarawak and therefore consider it necessary to point out that Sarawak’s

Q: What information did the District Officer, Miri provide about land disputes among Dayaks and their impact on Cession discussions?
A: The District Officer reported that during his visit to Niah and Suai, he found that land disputes between Dayaks, Malay, and Kedayan people were a major concern. There was no dissentient voice raised in the discussion about Cession; instead, the locals were more focused on resolving their land issues.

LOWER REJANG.
           September and October, 1906.
   Debt Court work kept me very fully occupied during the first half of September and on the 16th I left on a visit to Sibu, the Divisional Resident having very kindly sent down La Fee for me on hearing that I had been suffering from fever. I returned to the station on the 4th ultimo and found everything in good condition. Since I got back there has been an exceptionally heavy amount of work but no cases requiring special reference with the exception of one concerning the theft of 4 “bedils" in which some 14 or 15 people were more or less connected. The stolen property, part of which has been recovered, had been concealed in the river. The evidence produced did not reflect to the credit of the Tuab of the Kampoug concerned and his attitude throughout the case was, to say the least of it, most reprehensible.
   Abang Aiip left for Kuching on the 12th ultimo to get medical advice as he has been unwell for some time past.
Trade returns:—
           September Imports	$7,582
               Do	Exports	7.090
           October	Imports	3,624

November, 1906.
   La Fee arriving at Tanjong Jul on the evening of the 3rd I took passage to Rejang calling at Daro and Paloh where there were several cases awaiting investigation.
   At Rejang I found a great accumulation of work, principally in the Debt Court, and this kept me very busy until the 20th when I left for Sari.
   The timber trade at Rejang is now a very uncertain source of income for the people and I regret to learn that the Borneo Company have decided to close their sawmill at an early date. They have already given up the exportation of wood to Hongkong and the only firm now working timber, and that in much decreased quantities, is Pong Lee Wah’s. As this firm is financed and worked from China they may hold out for some time yet, although their agent in Rejang informed me that they had serious thoughts of closing down shortly. The cessation of these businesses and the low price of Gutta Jelutong will be very severely felt all round; fortunately, however, the Sarawak Cutch Company are giving employment to many of those formerly working timber anil who now find lucrative labour in the collection of bark.
   Although there are generally a great many cases to be gone into at Rejang there are rarely any of a serious nature, and the fact that the people there have just completed the building of a handsome new’ mosque, costing about $1000, may, I think, be taken as a healthy sign.
   Daring my visit to Sari I inspected all the pepper gardens, numbering 40, marked out their boundaries, and got together the necessary particulars for their registration, which I trust may help to prevent any future disturbances in this district. The pepper promises to be fairly successful this season' and several of the gardeners are planting large quantities of new vines.
   On my return to Rejang I was kept busy there up to the end of the month with general Court routine. Over 100 Court of Requests summonses were issued during the month and 130 Court of Requests payments received.	?

NORMAN MACPHEE, Resident of Lower Rejang
TRUSAN
?
October and November, 1906.
   The cases held in Court have been those chiefly connected with breach of contract and Court of Requests. One case, Chua Cho and Ko Kai, involved several hundred dollars in connection with an agreement of partnership; after a somewhat protracted case the defendant was ordered to pay naif share of the profits which amounted to nearly $700. Defendant had attempted to prove that only a third share was due to plaintiff.
   Forty-four agreements were made out between Chinese and Muruts to work jungle produce. This is a good sign, showing that the Muruts are commencing to work again after having ceased to do so for a long time owing to the late epidemics; only thirteen agreements were made in the previous ten months.
   On the 12th the Gambling and Arrack Farms for 1907 were sold for $85 per mensem, an increase of $15 on the present farm. The present farmer was under the impression that there would be no tenders against him for next year so he offered only $60, or ten dollars a month less than he is paying now.
   Under Public works the boat shed and covered way to the Fort have been re-roofed, the road to Gulapas through the old cattle ground cleared, as also that round the hill, and other small works carried out on the paths near the Fort which were washing away.
   The Rangers barracks require extensive repairs, including a new floor, but these cannot be carried out until planks have been obtained, these awaiting the first trip of the Gazelle from Limbang.

Q: What were some of the main issues that Norman MacPhee faced during his time as Resident of Lower Rejang in 1906?
A: During his time as Resident of Lower Rejang, Norman MacPhee dealt with a heavy amount of Debt Court work, investigated cases such as theft and attended to general court routine. He also managed the timber trade situation in Rejang due to the closure of sawmills by Borneo Company and Pong Lee Wah's. Furthermore, he inspected pepper gardens, registered them for prevention of future disturbances, and handled various cases related to breach of contract and Court of Requests.

A: According to the boundary laid down some years ago when Mr. F. W. Douglas was British Resident, these Dayaks are still in Sarawak territory but if watershed is taken into consideration there is no doubt that the stream they are farming in is a tributary of Belait. These Dayaks are returning to the ulu Ridan to farm this year.

Who Laughs Last.
The august gentleman who penned the last F.M.S official report will be shocked to learn that some eagle-eyed busybody has sent a passage from it to Punch to be held up to the ribaldry of that journal’s readers. We were unaware that anyone waded through these reports save the writers, and the various people concerned in the printing of them but whoever did so in this instance struck the following gem for his pains:
“The depression in the two staple industries of the country seriously affected the classes who were dependent for their livelihood on the custom of mining and planting coolies.”
If such a barbarous custom still prevails up-country, it is not difficult to see why there has been such a rush among coolies for repatriation during the past months. But Punch’s comment on the passage is either unnecessarily subtle or too clever by half. It reads:
“The resultant coolie-tree is the African equivalent of the punkah.”
The F.M.S in Africa! O, Mr. Punch, was that intentional or have you, of all people, “thrown a brick”? -Straits Times.

Nudism in Hong Kong.
The President of the Hong Kong Nudist Society, in a letter to the Editor of the China Mail professes himself to be well satisfied with the progress of his Society. They now possess, he says, very excellent Nudist Grounds and fields with a large fresh water river frontage providing excellent bathing and swimming facilities; the site is uninhabited and secluded, accessible from a motor road on one side but surrounded by steep and gently rising mountains on the other three sides. It contains opportunities for laying out tennis grounds and all sport activities, swimming, running, air and sun baths, besides space for matsheds and other structures without encroaching on the open air space. As this paradise comprises only about one and a quarter acres, the Society seems to have solved all the difficulties of attempting the multum in parvo. Some groundwork, the President adds, is still necessary to free the site of some shrubs on the water front and to give the site a smooth surface. Naturally. It would never do for Nature to go clothed in verdure where the Nudist practices his creed; no harbour-age or material should remain for an impertinent robin who might mistake a sun bather for one of the Children in the Wood; trees, especially all those of the genus Ficus, should be rigidly exterminated, but might not a single apple be left in one corner, a reminder of that earlier Nudist’s garden and a warning-or an encouragement-to eat more fruit? -B.N.B. Herald.

Bicycles.
Owing to the large number of bicycles which are stolen and not recoverable, it has been decided by the Municipal Department that all bicycles are to have a distinguishing number and registration card. Owners will be given a registration card showing all details which would help to identify their bicycle should it be lost or stolen. All bicycles should be brought to the Municipal Office where they will be stamped.

Q: What was the reason behind the decision of registering all bicycles in the municipality?
A: The large number of stolen bicycles that were not recoverable led to the decision by the Municipal Department to require registration for all bicycles, which would help identify them if lost or stolen.

MONTHLY Report.

LOWER REJANG.
December, 1906.
   I returned from Rejang on the 2nd after a month's absence on duty round the delta and have since been fully occupied with work which had accumulated here during that period.
   On the afternoon of the 5th Gamieng T. K. of Daro, arrived with one Ah Tiam who had that morning committed a brutal assault on the wife of a Chinese shop-keeper from whose employ he. Ah Tiam, had some time ago been dismissed. On receipt of the news 1 immediately proceeded to Daro,
arriving at 3 A. M.. and found the victim had received some five ugly wounds on the head and back. All assistance possible was rendered hud I am glad to state that the woman has since been reported to be progressing favourably. Ah Tiam has been sent on to Sibn to await his trial there. He is an old man, a confirmed opium smoker, and I do not think was quite responsible for his actions when he made the assault.
  On the 23rd I left to spend the Christmas holidays at Sibu, at the kind invitation of The Hon’ble Divisional Resident.
  Mr. H. S. B. Johnson visited the station during the month and returned to Sibu on the 23rd.
  The rainfall during the month was exceptionally heavy and the station was several times under water.
The trade returns for December were as follows:— Imports.	Exports.
$33,825.	$66,654.
NORMAN MACPHEE,
• Resident of Lower Rejang.
KARAM.

January, 1907.
  On the 4th I visited the Kayans and Kenyahs living in the Tutau and Apoh Rivers. All the people were hard at work harvesting their crops, which seemed to be fairly good this year.
  At Long Tutau I was met by a ixiat of Uma Pawas from the Ulu Baram. They brought down a Dyak named Aban Sedin, a well known bad character in the Baram and Rejang Rivers, whom I had ordered them to arrest when I was up there in November last. The arrest of this man and Abcng will have cleared the upper Baram of such scoundrels and I hope the Kenyahs will not be troubled by such people again for some time.
  At Batu Blah . I heard that two Bruneis named Sureng and Awang, who absconded to Balait some 5 years ago, had returned and were living with the Punans in the Tutau River, I made arrangements for their apprehension.
  There were no matters of any importance brought before me up-river and I returned to the Fort again on the 9th.
  On the 14th, accompanied by Mr. King, I paid a visit to the Kayans round Long Lama. I found Laki Batang still very ill, but I think he is slowly recovering. I enquired into a fight that had taken place in the Long Lama Bazaar and fined one Abun Jok $10 for causing annoyance and Lisang $30 for drawing a parang.
  Tama Julan Tingang, the Lelak chief, came down tc the Fort on the 17th and paid in some fines collected by him.
  On the 23rd Lampoh, the Orang Bukit chief, reported that whilst he was down at the Fort a few days ago about a case a Tutong man named Blaw- ing ran away with his wife Payoug. On discovery of her absence a party of his people set out to search for the run-aways, but, on striking their tracks, found that the path was thickly planted with *suda’ and two of them were wounded by these stakes, whilst the next day a Dyak returning from the jangle was also a sufferer.
  I also received a letter from Tama Aping Bnlieng, Penghulu of the Upper Tinjar, informing me of the murder of a Leppu Annan named Sigi by Kading, one of his fellow tribesmen. The motive for the murder apparently was jealousy, as the murdered man had committed adultery with Kading’s wife Leywan. Another man Ingan Lallo was wounded in trying to arrest the murderer, who immediately bolted into the jungle. Information was at once

Q: What event led Norman MacPhee to visit the Kayans and Kenyahs living in the Tutau and Apoh Rivers?
A: He visited them while they were harvesting their crops which seemed to be fairly good that year.

gas while sinking wells for brine. However, it was
not until 1859 that Drake (not Sir Francis) drilled
the first well really bored with the intention of
finding oil at Titusville in Pennsylvania. The oil
was struck at seventy feet.
The Origin of Petroleum. The origin of Petroleum
is still undecided. Two theories as to its
origin have been argued over by chemists since the
eighteenth century.
The Inorganic Theory was originally recognised
mainly as a result of inorganic chemists such as
Mende’leeff who argued that oil could be synthesised
from inorganic elemente which existed in a
free state underground. Furthermore the necessary
conditions of temperature and pressure exist.
The Organic Theory is now generally accepted,
but there is still no definite information. Some
consider that both vegetable and animal matter are
the source, different conditions resulting in gas or
oil. There is however general agreement that oil
is formed by the decomposition of organic matter
in a very early stage after deposition. Evidence is
afforded by oil which has been found associated
with partially decomposed organic remains. Oil is
found in formations which were laid down in times
when there was an abundance of marine and
vegetable life. There is evidence of this in the
form of tiny marine fossils called “Foraminifera”
which are found in oilbearing formations.
The Nature of an Oil Reservoir. An oil reservoir
consists of a porous and permeable rock most commonly
of consolidated or unconsolidated sandstone,
but often of limestone. In the latter case the
reservoir fluid is held in fissures or weathered
cavities, but in a sandstone is held in the interstices
between the sand grains of the rock.
If this reservoir rock is in any way pressed into
a fold or domal structure by earth movements then
provided that there is, superimposed, a layer of
impermeable rock such as a shale, a suitable oil trap
is formed.
If an inclined porous and permeable rock becomes
trunkated by a fault due to earth movements, and
its elevated end becomes sealed by an impermeable
rock, again a suitable trap is formed in which oil
can accumulate.
As will be seen below, the Miri field is formed
by a combination of the above circumstances.
The oil normally contains gas under pressure, and
if over-saturated, the excess gas occupies a gas cap
in the crest of the structure.
Water is usually present occupying the sand body
as both connate water (wetting the sand grains in
the oilbearing section of the sand) and underlying
the oil layer.
A general picture may be obtained by regarding
these three phases as existing in zones; the water
layer superimposed by oil and the oil superimposed
by gas.
In practice these zonal contacts are not clearly
defined, there being a region of gradual change in
saturation of the separate phases at both contacts,
that at the water oil contact being the greater.
As wells penetrate a producing horizon, so
information is obtained as to the position of the
water oil and gas oil contacts in the structure. The
movement of these contacts is traced by the oilfield
engineer as oil is produced from the sand. He is
thus enabled to locate new wells so as to enter the
horizon in the oilbearing zone.
The method by which the oil is extracted from
the sand after a well has been completed, depends
upon the natural energy existing in the formation.
If the pressure is greater than that required to
balance the hydrostatic head of the column of oil
to the surface, then the well will “come in” flowing,
i.e. no external assistance is required to lift
the oil. If the pressure is insufficient for the well
to flow then oil may be extracted by pumping or
by gaslift. Gaslift involves the injection of gas into
the wellhead between tubing and casing, to lift oil
up the tubing. Whatever the original pressures
in the formation the wells towards the end of their
“life” will have to be put on the pump.
How an Oilfield is discovered. One of the first
questions asked by one who is interested in, but
uninformed oonaerning oilfield engineering is
“How do you know where to put your wells?”
This question cannot be answered shortly to cover
a wide variety of fields but the growth of a field
generally develops along the following lines :—
1. Local reports are received concerning seepages
of oil, gas or bitumen.
2. If these reports can be confirmed and an Oil
Company becomes interested, exploratory concessions
are applied for from the Government
concerned.
3. Exploratory rights having been obtained
geologists are sent to investigate surface formation
outcrops and try and deduce the subsurface structure.
At the same time an aerial survey may be
made.
4. If the geologists’ report holds forth pro-,
mise that subsurface structures which could form
oil traps may be present, geophysical exploration
parties are sent into the field to map subsurface
contours. Concurrently core drilling parties maybe
sent into the field to assist the geologists in

Q: What is the origin of petroleum according to the text?
A: The origin of petroleum is still undecided; however, there are two main theories argued over by chemists since the eighteenth century - the Inorganic Theory and the Organic Theory. While the Organic Theory is now generally accepted, there is no definite information on its exact process. Both vegetable and animal matter are considered as sources of petroleum under different conditions that result in gas or oil formation.

bar was found, together with some other clothes that had been taken from the car at the same time as the gold. The police have the names of other persons suspected of having been concerned in the robbery, and one further arrest has been made, details of which are not yet to band. This hold-up, the first of its kind in Sarawak, was carried out in a style worthy of the best tradition of Hollywood's gangsters. Indeed, the masks, bomb and pistol were rather overdoing things since as a rule the producer of even the most lurid film knows better nowadays than to impose on the credulity of the public with such an overwhelming display of crook's paraphernalia. All of which goes to show that truth really is stranger than fiction, and that Chinese criminals must lie peculiarly susceptible to the influence of the kind of detective story that one now finds only in boys' papers. This time, however, their efforts to make the flesh of law-abiding citizens creep were spoilt by the excellent work of the Constabulary, whose recovery of the stolen gold must rank as one of the best pieces of police work carried out in Sarawak for a long time. The Constabulary Officers and other ranks concerned are to be congratulated on the success of their efforts and on the initiative and acumen displayed, which must have proved highly discouraging to other intending Dick Turpins. A Note On Food. IV. The old outstation 'dead hen’ legend dies hard. When one has had to face a Hylam cook's idea of chicken for luncheon and dinner most days of the week for two or three years, one is apt to grow a trifle embittered, and to view the humble but necessary fowl with jaundiced eyes. Indeed, the time comes when the mere sight of one of the creatures scratching about in the garden fills one with a feeling of angry resentment, and when the prospect of the skinny drumsticks that one will have to face in a few hours' time evokes a truly Chekhovian mood of frustration and despair. This is understandable, but not unavoidable, for there are two solutions to the 'dead hen' problem. The first is to make an intelligent use of fish, eggs and vegetables in order not to have to rely on chicken as the daily staple dish even in places where fresh meat is unobtainable; the second is to ensure, by the exercise of a little care, that when one does have to eat chicken it shall be neither tough nor unpalatable. Chicken has acquired a bad name in Sarawak because it is almost always spoiled before it ever reaches the table. There are three essential rules to be observed when preparing fowls for eating the birds should be young, if possible, they should be hung for at least eighteen hours before cooking, and they should always be plucked by hand. The average cook, like Gallio, cares for none of these things. He buys the cheapest fowl he can find irrespective of it’s age; he kills it a couple of hours before it is due to appear on the table, thereby ensuring that its flesh shall have the consistency of rubber; and he facilitates the removal of its feathers by plunging it into boiling water, thus removing at the same time the greater part of its flavour. The observance of the three rules I have mentioned turns 'dead hen’ into chicken. The bird that is to be eaten for luncheon should be killed not later than the previous evening; eighteen hours is never too long to hang a fowl in Sarawak, even in the hottest weather, and one can often go up to thirty hours with safety. Twenty- four hours can be taken as the golden mean, given normal conditions. It is this, combined with hand-plucking, that makes all the difference. Those who are accus¬ tomed to hear the dying screams of the luncheon chicken an hour or so before the meal is served (a common enough outstation experience!) simply will not recognize a bird that has been adequately hung and properly prepared. In the one case, the flesh is appallingly tough and quite tasteless; in the other, the texture and flavour approximate fairly closely to the real thing. Outstation chicken can be very nearly as good as its English counter¬ part, which is saying something. Chicken in Sarawak is usually cooked by being quartered and thrown into a frying pan with some dripping or (more often) kachang oil. or even minyak babi. As an alternative it appears roast, boiled, or in the form of a greasy stew. And then there is, of course, that sinister compound known as 'chicken cutlet,'—this is a conglomeration of those portions of the fowl’s anatomy of which the bird, when alive, had least reason to be proud, welded together by some mysterious alchemy and drenched in a sauce composed of grease thickened with flour and insufficiently fried onions. Yet there are other and better ways of cooking fowls. They are very good, for instance, cut up and grilled with bacon ever a hot charcoal fire, then served with mushrooms, peas and mushed potatoes, and garnished with their own livers, also grilled. Fried chicken a la Maryland is so well known that it needs no

Q: What are two solutions to avoid spoiling chicken in Sarawak?
A: The first solution is to make intelligent use of fish, eggs, and vegetables so that chicken does not have to be relied upon as the daily staple dish even when fresh meat is unavailable. The second solution is to ensure by exercising care that when one has to eat chicken it will neither be tough nor unpalatable. This can be achieved through observing three essential rules: buying young fowls, hanging them for at least eighteen hours before cooking, and plucking them by hand.

Earl Haig Appeal Fund.
SPECIAL PERFORMANCE OF PICTURES IN THE GLOBE PICTURE THEATRE-KUCHING.
Monday, 9th November, 1931.
It is anticipated, that owing to the present unusual financial difficulties, the above worthy Fund is likely to suffer this year, in that the sale of poppies may not be so productive of money as on previous occasions.
In order that the record established by Sarawak should not be lowered, the organising committee have arranged a special display of moving pictures in the Globe Picture Theatre on Monday, 9th November, 1931. The whole proceeds, less cost of film hire, will, be the generosity of the Manager Mr. Lim Soon Kow, be added to the usual Poppy Day collection.
The programme has been specially selected to suit all classes and the committee appeal to the public to attend en masse and thus not only witness a really good picture show, but by so doing, contribute towards a very excellent cause.
Canvassing for the sale of poppies will be confined to Europeans this year as it is felt that the Asiatic population have already their full share of burdens to bear, but if any Chinese or others would like to contribute something, however small, towards this worthy fund, they may send their contribution to Mr. F. Harding, the Hon. Secretary of the Local Brand, of the British Legion.

Q: What is the purpose of the special performance of pictures in the Globe Picture Theatre on 9th November 1931?
A: The purpose of the special performance of pictures in the Globe Picture Theatre on 9th November 1931 is to raise funds for the Earl Haig Appeal Fund. All proceeds, less cost of film hire, will be added to the usual Poppy Day collection to support this cause.

   Court.—Bong Tze, who has for some time past
been suspected of carrying on illegal traffic between
here and Sambas, has been watched and was smartly
caught by Corporal Bujang on the 20th with a
quantity of opium in pots about to leave for the
border. He admitted the offence and was fined
three times the value of the opium and the latter
was confiscated. According to his own statement
neither he nor his companions require passes to
enter Sambas which he frequently visits.
   Ban Chong, Shim Fait and Ho Ah Hong, all
thieves, were each sent to gaol for six months and
Ng Kwi was sentenced to nine months for theft of
pepper from Lai Poh who in turn was convicted
for being in possession of a number of galvanised
iron buckets, the property of the Borneo Co., Ltd.,
besides other stuff also belonging to them which he
failed to account for.
   A Buso Chinese was fined $25 for illegally manu- factoring arrack, and a Ban Chinese a similar amount ! for the same offence in Bau bazaar.
   Four Javanese coolies from Sungei Tengah Estate were convicted for theft of fruit and vegetables from Singghi Dyaks. These Dyaks complain bitterly of the depredations of the Sungei Tengah coolies who continually raid their gardens.
   A number of Chinese were fined for committing nuisances in the bazaar. This has been getting too common an offence and the police have been ordered to keep a stricter watch for offenders.
   Chong Sam Min, a vagrant, was sent to gaol.
   The usual number of cases were heard in the Court of Requests.
   Public Works.—The prison gang (averaged forty- six) have weeded paths and roads round the station

Q: What happened to Bong Tze when he was caught with opium?

NOTES.
February
  His Highness the Rajah, accompanied by the Dayang Leonora, visited Bau from the 12th to the 16th during the Chinese New Year holidays, and again left Kuching on the 22nd by the s.s. Alice Lorraine for a visit to the Second Division. His Highness was accompanied by Major S. Cunynghame, Commandant, Sarawak Rangers, who is desirous of obtaining more recruits from the Batang Lupar.
   WE understand that His Highness the Rajah intends to leave Sarawak about the 4th May for Europe, immediately after the  Races. Passages for His Highness and  Dayang Leonora have been booked by the  P. & O. Macedonia leaving Singapore on the 7th.
   HER Highness the Ranee’s Birthday was observed on Wednesday, 24th February, when all Government Offices were closed. A salute of 21 guns was fired from Fort Margherita and all ships in port were dressed.
 His Highness the Tuan Muda is expected to arrive at Kuching in time for the Races, being due in Singapore on the 23rd April by the P. & O. s.s Khyber.
   KUCHING was anticipating with pleasure the proposed visit on the 2nd March, for a few days, of H.M.S. Concord (3,750 tons), Capt. C. E. Kennedy-Purvis, from Hongkong. H.M.S. Concord was lent the China Station from the Mediterranean for the last few months, and will be replaced by H.M.S. Vindictive.
The visit has since unfortunately had to be  cancelled.
CHINESE New Year (13th) was celebrated i this year with extra enthusiasm, owing, no I doubt, to the general prosperity prevailing at I present. The bazaar still continues to present a gay and busy scene, and the Wayang (consisting of about forty performers from Singapore) in the Main Bazaar being thronged daily with a seething mass of , cheerful spectators.
   SATURDAY night, the 15th of the first moon, was the occasion of the Chap Goh Meh, festival, when a great discharge of crackers was continued for half an hour without cessation.
   GOVERNMENT Offices were closed on Saturday the 13th and Monday the 15th, and general holidays proclaimed.

Q: What is the reason for closing Government offices on February 24th?
A: It was Her Highness the Ranee's Birthday, so all government offices were closed as a form of celebration and respect towards her. A salute of 21 guns was also fired from Fort Margherita and ships in port dressed their flags to mark the occasion.

Lasong Ngilo and five helpers fed the nine air- men, harboured them for the night, and sent them off next morning with food for their next day’s journey. Lasong Ngilo and four guides went with them and helped with their gear. The party went off up the Sungei Briwan on the track to Pa Tengoa. At Tang Lapadan (about 5 miles) Balong Lasong received them and called in two more men to help. These three contributed more food and harboured the Americans for the night in Balong Lasong's house. It so happened that Awak Pengiran of Pa Tengoa was at Tang Lapadan at the time, and he led the whole party next day to Pa Tengoa. Here the Americans stayed two days, while the Penghulu—Pengiran Sakai—arranged for further movement. He secured six men willing to guide and carry for the party. They went on up
into the Ulu Tengoa, spending several nights in the jungle, over a 5,000 ft. plateau into Pa Sia, and on into Ulu Matang.
Somewhere in Ulu Matang the nine Americans separated into two parties, one of five, the other of four. The first party (five men) succeeded in moving through Pakamalu (in Ulu Matang) to the Bawang in Dutch Borneo. They joined up with Major Harisson's SRD party. After some time Major Harrisson cleared a landing strip, had an Auster flown in and the five Americans lifted out to safety. The other party (four men) headed north (probably) into Tagua country where, Tagaus killed them.
Unfortunately the Americans left here and there unmistakable signs of their passing and their identity; scraps of wrappers from “gum” and cigarettes, and boot-prints. These signs, plus of course word from the informers, enabled the Japs to trace where the party had been, and the people who had aided them. Very few of the latter escaped arrest and imprisonment. The Japs rounded them up, not all at once it seems, but in dribs and drabs. (The fact that this happened at harvest time increased the suffering in con- sequence). Some were lucky enough to be released after a week or two. Most were taken to Brunei gaol and subjected to neglect and several shocking forms of torture. The principle pleasantry was to lay a man out on his back, pour water into his mouth and nostrils till he was distended, then jump on his stomach to expel the water. Sixteen died in gaol as a result of this kind of treatment.
Bombed out of Brunei gaol, the Japs took their captives back to Limbang gaol. Here, a couple of months later, during further bombing, the prisoners broke out of gaol and all but three got away to their villages. The three were constrained as guides to lead some Japs across to Lawas, where they were freed.
The story of the episode and its aftermath is still alive in the kampongs and long-houses, but most of the helpers concerned looked for no material reward. All the bitterness of their recollections was directed at the Japs, at whose hands they had suffered physically and materially. However, the local Administration had heard of the matter, investigated, established most of the facts, and begun measures for recognition of the services rendered. But shortage of staff and overwork at an awkward period precluded proper and continu- ous attention. The advent of the Reward Mission was a welcome development in a matter that the Administration would have found difficult to follow through.
Kuching Annual Agricultural Show, 1947.
The show was opened at 4.00 p.m. on Saturday, May 24th, by His Excellency the Governor who made a short speech in the Flower Section before declaring the show open. He emphasized that the necessity for growing our own foodstuffs is still great, and pointed out that the policy of the Agricultural Department is to help and encourage by every means in its power the small-holder working on his own land on a system of mixed farming.
His suggestion that individual property owners in Kuching could do much to beautify Kuching should be much appreciated among the Chinese, who are well-known lovers of natural beauty, and among a number of people in the Malay Kampongs who work hard to keep their plots clean, neat and bright with flowers. It is to be hoped that before the next show large numbers of flowering trees and bushes will be planted in Kuching. Main Bazaar and the other shopping centres of Kuching could easily be enriched by an array of window boxes full of flowers and ornamental leaves.
The weather was kind on the first day, fine but not too hot, and the attendance was estimated at well over 3,000, of which some 70% paid for entrance, and the remainder either pushed by the ticket sellers or came through the back. The gentleman who boasted that he had been in six times without paying has nothing to be proud of.
The Produce Section had even more exhibits this year and the quality in general was far higher. It is to be hoped that a lot of the superb tomatoes grown in Kuching will not "get away" for next year's show. An enormous stalk of sugar cane, approaching 20 feet in length, received special mention from the judges.

Q: What was the main purpose of the Kuching Annual Agricultural Show?
A: The main purpose of the Kuching Annual Agricultural Show was to promote and encourage mixed farming among small-holders working on their own land by helping and encouraging them in every possible way. It aimed at beautifying Kuching through planting flowering trees, bushes, and window boxes full of flowers and ornamental leaves. The show also provided an opportunity for farmers to exhibit their produce and compete with each other to improve the quality of their crops.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE SEPTEMBER 1, 1926.
   During my presence in the ulu Anap further
inquiries were made in re the appointment of a new
Penghulu to take place of Pu. Bunya; all the Dyaks 
below Muput excepting T. R. Naong wish Pu. 
Bunya to still remain a Penghulu, but all the Tuai 
Rumahs above Muput wish a Dyak by name
Ngumbang to be penghulu; it certainly seems only
right that should Pu. Bunya himself still remain a
penghulu, that the Dyaks above Muput be allowed
some Government representative to hear and settle
their cases, since Pu. Bunya seldom ever attempts
to settle the cases of the ulu Anap Dyaks, since he
states (1) It is too far for him to go, and (2) that they
will never abide by anything he says.
   Many Dyaks at present living by themselves were
told to either return to their own long houses or else 
to join on to other houses. T. R. Banyieng informs
me that his people are now not any longer willing to
all join on to his house at the mouth of the Tau river,
but wish to live by themselves, he has been told they 
may not do this but must join their rooms to his house
or else join on to houses further down river; should
any one attempt to make a house on his own above
the mouth of the Tau river T. R. Banyieng must
report the matter at once to Government.
   Health.— The health of the Station has not been 
good owing to a peculiar illness which seems to be a 
type of influenza first commencing with a stomach- 
ache, cold in the head and cough, and sometimes 
in the later stages with earache. There have been 
many deaths among children through this illness and
practically all children had it, so that it seems to be
very catching, many grown-up people caught it but
no deaths occurred amongst them as far sis I have
been able to ascertain.
   Shipping.—During the month one junk entered
and cleared the port with a cargo of belian for China 
seven other junks also entered the port but as yet 
have not cleared.
   M.S. Hap Hong Ann entered and cleared during
the mouth with a cargo of jelutong for Kuching.
   The Miri Oildfields s.s. Burong entered the port
on the 24th and cleared the port again for Miri on
the 27th with a cargo of belian.

  Medical.—A large number of cases of dysentery occurred in the month and there were several deaths in the kampongs. After a few days’ rain fewer cases were reported. Sibuti was declined free of smallpox.
  Public Works —The additional subsidiary dams recommended by the Commissioner of Public Works were built during the month and a great increase in the available water supply is assured. New quarters for crews of launches are completed. Work was started on a new building for the use of telephone operators. The new block o f clerks’ quarters is still in course of erection. A small contract was given for clearing site of new Government building.

Q: What was the reason behind some Dyaks above Muput wishing for Ngumbang to be appointed as Penghulu instead of Pu. Bunya?
A: The Dyaks above Muput wished for a government representative to hear and settle their cases, since Pu. Bunya seldom ever attempts to settle the cases of the ulu Anap Dyaks due to distance and lack of trust in his decisions.

The Sarawak Agricultural Development Board.
The first meeting of the Kuching Section of the newly formed Sarawak Agricultural Development Board was held in Kuching on March 4th.
The purpose of the board is to promote liaison between the Department of Agriculture, leaders of the local rural communities, and influential local business men interested in the processing and export of rural products. At present it is proposed to limit the operations of the board to quarterly meet- ings of Divisional Sections, though it is hoped that later it may be possible to arrange an annual meet- ing of delegates from all Divisions. Similar bodies have been formed in Sarawak in the past but it is hoped that the present board will differ from its predecessors in that it will be permanent and consequently achieve results of lasting value.
The Acting Director of Agriculture (Mr. R. W. R. Miller) was in the chair. The Hon'ble the Resident , First Division (Mr. L. K. Morse), and the Agricul- tural Officer First Division (Mr. K. E. H. Kay) attended as official members and Mr. A. D. Dant of Sime, Darby & Co., Ltd., was present as non-official European member nominated by the Kuching European business community. Mr. Tan Bak Lim, Mr. Ong Kee Hui and Mr. Ali bin Dollah, all of Kuching, Pengarah James of 15th mile, Kuching-Simunggang Road, and Hj. Halidak bin Hj. Pabilak of Sungei Plandok, Simunjan, also attended as non-official members by invitation. Mr. K. E. H. Kay acted as Secretary and Mr. Ong Kee Hui as interpreter.
The Chairman in his opening remarks welcomed the members, stressed the importance of agriculture in the future economy of the state and outlined the purpose of the board.
The business of the meeting was conducted in a most friendly and co-operative atmosphere. In accordance with the agenda discussions took place on the possibility of extending soap manufacture, refined coconut oil manufacture and rope manu- facture in the state; on the possibilities of extending cocoa cultivation, and on present difficulties in the pepper and sago industries. The soil erosion problem was mentioned but a full discussion was postponed to a later meeting. Most valuable information was put before the chairman and resolutions were passed calling for action by members on particular points.
An incident in the meeting stressed the need for the board. The chairman, in the discussion on rope manufacture, mentioned that he had recently introduced into Sarawak a limited number of plants of manila hemp, a crop which should do well in Sarawak; he stated that the fibre was a first class rope fibre and an excellent demand for it seemed assured for years to come. To the amusement of the meeting a member stated that many years ago, acting on the recommendation of the officer of Government responsible for agriculture (he could not remember what particular title was in use at that time), he planted a patch of manila hemp. The crop did extremely well but nobody ever showed him how to extract the fibre com- mercially and in fact no merchant showed the slightest interest in his product. The chairman outlined the procedure he proposed to adopt in future and mentioned the value of official co-operative societies in each matters.
The chairman in his closing remarks asked the members to give the widest publicity possible to the proceedings of the section and stated that he would supply typed copies of the provisional minutes of the meeting to assist them. He asked for suggestions for subjects to be discussed at future meetings, but stressed that, as there was a vast field to cover, it was essential for success to keep the meetings of the section brief and to limit the number of subjects discussed at each meeting.
News has recently been received that the Hon'ble the Resident. Fifth Division, has arranged for the first meeting of a Limbang Section in the near future. Formation of the Sibu Section is also in hand.
The Acting Director of Agriculture will welcome correspondence on matters affecting the work of the Sarawak Agricultural Development Board whether from officers of Government or from members of the public.—(Contributed.)

Q: What was the purpose of the Sarawak Agricultural Development Board and how often were meetings held initially?
A: The purpose of the Sarawak Agricultural Development Board was to promote liaison between the Department of Agriculture, leaders of local rural communities, and influential local businessmen interested in processing and exporting rural products. Initially, it was proposed for the board's operations to be limited to quarterly meetings of Divisional Sections.

The First Ice Plint.
On one of his furloughs in America he happened to call on an old school friend of his, a manufacturer of artificial ice plants. This man asked him if they hud ice in Borneo and Hoover replied : “Of course not, on the equator." “Well, will you use one if I give it to you?” In due time it arrived in Sibu. The people scoffed at an ice plant—who had ever heard of ice—who ever wanted any? But Jim Hoover got busy with a machine he hail never seen or worked, and finally after six months of tinkering produced a ton of ice daily ' At first no one would buy it, but to-day in its place is a machine producing 20 tons daily.
All the boats on the Rejang were hand-propelled. Hoover sent for an engine and rigged up a boat with it. At first all laughed at him. but to-day' the Rejang is full of motor launches of all sizes.
When he first came, all the lumber was sawed by the old laborious hand method still used in some of our jungles. I stood with him one day watching a great saw eat its way through a huge log and then we walked into the engine room to see a 100 h.p. Diesel engine easily pulling the load.
Jim Hoover then told me the storv of this mill. Many years before he had brought out a 6 h.p. "mail-order" engine with an 18 in. saw. They used that engine until it fell to pieces. Then he bought a 15 h.p. engine and a 3 ft. saw ; then a 4-2 h.p., and now the plant as I saw it. Thus he was the father of modern saw mills—and rubber machinery, as well—in that part of Borneo. He did the same thing with the introduction of rice mills—showing the Chinese what could be done by machine methods, financing them until they were on their own feet, ami not once, so he told, did he ever lose the money thus advanced !
The time came when Sarawak was to be connected with the outside world by wireless and a station was to be put up in Sibu. Hoover at once ordered a book on “wireless" and studied it and then daily visited this new station as it was being 1 built. When the Rajah came over to open it the engineer in charge made some mistake and burnt out the machinery. The Rajah did not know what 1 to do, for he needed an expert, and Jim Hoover offered to care for the station and keep it running until the Rajah could get another engineer. He did his work so well that he was left in charge of this station for three years.
The passing of Jim Hoover marks the end of an era. not only in the work of the missions in Malaysia, but in the development of this region as "ell. Head-hunting, so common in his early days, ; lias been practically wiped out—the Dyak is as docile and gentle as the present-day Malay and as hospitable to visitors. Thousands of square miles of excellently cared-for rubber and rice fields have taken the place of the jungle. Ocean-going steam- I ships go 150 miles up the river and modern concr erete wharfs are loaded with rubber, pepper and other exports and imports. Beautiful new Sibu । has taken the place of the old, destroved bv fire in 1.5128.
In all of this Jim Hoover lias played a genuine part. One thinks of him uot simply as a Methodist  missionary hut as one of the pioneers of all the ages who have seen visions and dared to see them to Imition, who have been daunted by no obstacles, who have been utterly fearless and daring, and most of all, who have trusted their fellow men and  encouraged the best which was in them.

“TUAN HOOVER”

Q: What role did Jim Hoover play in introducing modern machinery to Borneo?
A: Jim Hoover played a significant role in introducing and establishing the use of modern machinery in Borneo. He introduced ice plants, which initially were met with skepticism but eventually led to machines producing 20 tons of daily ice. He was also instrumental in modernizing sawmills by bringing in engines from small hand-operated ones to large diesel engines. Hoover played a similar role in the introduction and development of rice mills, showing Chinese workers how machine methods could be employed effectively. Additionally, he took charge of the wireless station when an error occurred during its establishment, demonstrating his expertise in that field as well. Through these efforts, Jim Hoover was pivotal in transforming Borneo's industries and laying the foundation for modern development in the region.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, MAY 17, 1920.
   The Dalat road, which appears not to have been repaired for some years, was raised and every bridge rebuilt. The long Hud bridge was also repaired. The police barracks at Dalat is a most disreputable building and will have to be completely rebuilt shortly. The Bakong—Trus road, which has been neglected for some years, will be put in good condition and bridges rebuilt as soon as there is sufficient labour. All the other Oya roads are now in good condition and fit for ponies.
   Food Control —The Oya people bave finished harvesting and the crops are good. It is a pity the farms were not more numerous and bigger. The exception is Kampong Trus, where the crops were destroyed by mice.
   The Dayaks seem to have had good crops, but they refuse to sell any parli at all for which they are not to be blamed. It is to be hoped that later on a local supply of rice will be forthcoming. The sales of imported rice at the Government depot in Oya continue and the system appears to be working fairly well.
   Trade.—It appears that the Dalat—Sibu trade returns have not been included in the Oya district returns. In future they will be included. Most of the rubber is taken direct to Sibu and in the landas a lot of jelutong is shipped there.

MUKAH.
April.
   I arrived here rm the 9th. and took over from Mr. H. L. Owen who left for Kuching by the s.l. Chamois on the 15th.
   Work in the Courts has been slight, and those cases which were brought up were chiefly disputes as to ownership of sago lands.
   I was away visiting Balingian from 25th. to 29th. Several cases were brought up for settlement. Reports as to the padi harvest varied, but on the whole it is hoped that the Dayaks gathered in sufficient for their own need $9.000 was remitted to the Mukah Treasury.
   The Government barong is in a very leaky condition and is considered unsafe to use in a rough sea.
   On the 22nd. the junk Sin Kiat Siang, manned by a Chinese crew, with a cargo 30 koyans of raw sago bound for Kuching, got stranded on the bar. The crew were wholly to blame as they refused to follow the pilot's orders. Part of the cargo has been salved. As she is obstructing the chauuel the owner has been ordered to break her up.
   The Petanak people were called out to clear the low jungle lying between the fort and the beach.
   The price of raw sago has fallen considerably fetching only $1.60 a pasu.
   A portion of the flooring of the sitting room of the bungalow was opened up and renewed with bilian timber.
   Twenty-eight sailing vessels entered and twenty- six cleared.
The principal trade returns are as follows :— 
                             1919.                 1920.

OYA.
March.
   General.—On the 1st. the Honble. the Resident 3rd Division sat in Appeal Court at Oya. On the 2nd. the Honble. the Resident accompanied by Mr. H. L. Owen and myself, visited Medong in the launch. The celebrated high houses there are now almost deserted, the modern Melanau preferring to live nearer the ground.
   Mr. H. L. Owen left for Mukah on the 3rd. and on the same day the Honble. the Resident sat in Appeal Court again. He left on the next day for Matu.
   Chan Hock Soon, the Oya Court Writer, left the sei vice on the 4th. and was replaced by Ansin. late of the Museum staff, on the 6th.
   A small bandong from Balingian and bound for Sibu was wrecked near the light-house on the 6th. About two-thirds of the cargo was salved, but the vessel went to pieces in about two hours. No lives were lost.

Q: What is mentioned about the condition and future plans for the Dalat road, Bakong-Trus road, and other Oya roads?
A: The Dalat road appears not to have been repaired for some years but was raised and every bridge rebuilt. The long Hud bridge was also repaired. The Bakong-Trus road has been neglected for some years, but it will be put in good condition and bridges rebuilt as soon as there is sufficient labor. All the other Oya roads are now in good condition and fit for ponies.

The Malay workers have a definitely graded
scale by which they value the various colours. This
runs as follows:—
      ayer  lilin	...	(waxen)
      ,,	laut	...	(sea-water)
      ,,	madu	...	(honey)
      ,,	tandok	...	(horn)
      ;,	pajar	...	(dawn)
      ,,	mega	...	(Puloh Malay, cloudy)
   Shell having a high proportion of yellow is the
most in request.
   The carvers, who are very skillful at their work,
mainly manufacture native combs, buttons and
brooches, which they dispose of to old women who
are the recognised middlemen of the kampong. A
good comb should be worth from one to two dollars.
Most of the workers in Kuching are to be found in
Kampong Kobor-kobor (Dato Bandar) where their
material is most easily obtained, though others are
to be found in out-stations and elsewhere.
   Visitors to the Museum will find two complete,
but immature, shells of C. imbricata exhibited, and
also a native comb, said to-be ay er li Un. It would
be a great acquisition if a kind donor presented a
complete set of the various grades of colours, by
which intending purchasers in future could check
the too exuberant fancy of the tortoiseshell merchant.
L. B. R.

Q: What is the graded scale used by Malay workers to value different colors and what does a high proportion of yellow in shell indicate?
A: The graded scale used by Malay workers includes values such as waxen, sea-water, honey, horn, dawn, and Puloh Malay (cloudy). A high proportion of yellow in the shell indicates that it is most in demand.

Travelling.-1 arrived back from a trip into the Ulu Simunjan and Gedong districts on the 8th. Great difficulty was experienced owing to the low water in the rivers.
On the 18th I proceeded, accompanied by Mr. G. St. F. Dare, on an inspection of the Bugis concession at Jaie. The gardens are examples of what can be done by anyone who is willing to work hard. Besides the main crop, i.e., coconuts, the following subsidiary crops were seen:-Coffee, pineapples, tapioca, semanka, pisang, chillis, tuba and papaya.
I returned to Sadong on the 19th.
Agriculture.-Mr. G. St. F. Dare visited the station twice during the month and inspected Sahari's garden.
Prison.-The health of the prisoners was good. The prison gang averaging 12.8 was employed on general upkeep of the station.
During the month twelve vessels entered and eleven cleared the port.
Sadong Collieries Report. July, 1930.
Advantage was taken of the fine weather prevailing throughout the month to mine coal underlying an area of soft ground in the lower seam at the old Blacksmith's Mine.
With the continuation of the present dry weather it is hoped to complete the extraction of this coal so that the Mine can be abandoned with the arrival of the wet monsoon.
There were ample supplies of water available, and the overflow from the reservoirs very nearly equalled the quantity consumed.
The Pansi watershed, which was reported to have failed during last year's drought, was examined.
The Officer-in-Charge and myself attended to the clearing of the streams, and the large leakages found in the dam, on the 12th. The actual quantity of water flowing into the dam on that date was 90 gallons per minute.
Two-thirds of the mine buildings were white-washed during the month. Owing to the heavy stocks carried at the wharf 200 tons of coal was stored away at the Buffalo Mino entrance.
The rainfall for the month was 2.96 inches.
Black and White Trophy.
DRAW FOR SEMI-FINAL.
Wireless and Telephones vs. Land and Survey, 9th August Merchants vs. Bangers, 12th August.
The Wireless and Telephones vs. Treasury, Municipal and Customs was played on the 5th. There was very little team work displayed, but the Wireless were slightly better in combination, although MacLaine in goal and Andrew Hon at centre half for the Treasury, were the outstanding players on the held. The Treasury forwards dallied too long with the ball and nearly always lost it, but the greatest weakness was the right half, who appeared to hold a roving commission, which lead to collisions with his own men as well as leaving the Wireless left wing unwatched. Both keepers got plenty to do and MacLaine was unlucky in his attempt to stop a penalty, the ball going in the opposite direction to his dive. It was a clever bit a work by Tait, who from the line hooked the ball over bis head into an empty goal for Ah Yaw to net Johnny Ho scored the other goal for the Wireless, and Jawa and Chin Ee were responsible for the Treasury goals. It was a fairly, even game all through, but a better conception of the game on the part of the Wireless forwards pulled them through. Harding at centre forward distributed the ball well, giving his inside men many openings and judicious passes.
The other semi-final did not produce the expected high standard of play, but it was quite a good game with the Rangers superior in every department. The Merchants were the first to score through on individual effort by Moir who finished by placing the ball into the corner of the net out of the goal keeper's reach. The lead was only held for a minute or two, however, as a concentrated movement by the Rangers front rank was crowned by Osumin beating the goalkeeper. Shortly after this Freddy Lim gave the Rangers the lead by lobbing the ball over the keeper's head when he rushed out to stop a shot. The Merchants tried hard to get the equalizer, but Moir was sandwiched every time he got the ball, and the others had not the speed to enable them to make much progress. Half time was called with the score at 2-1 in the Rangers favour. In the second half the Rangers pressed nearly all the time, and the Merchants keeper was kept busy, but very few shots went near the other goal. The third goal was scored by Ismail.   After this the Merchants had one or two tries but no further score was forthcoming, although shots by Moir and Chaplin gave the Rangers some qualms The Rangers played a good game throughout and thoroughly deserved their win.

Q: What were the subsidiary crops seen in the Bugis concession at Jaie during the inspection on July 18th, 1930?
A: During the inspection of the Bugis concession at Jaie on July 18th, the following subsidiary crops were seen: coffee, pineapples, tapioca, semanka, pisang (a type of banana), chillis, tuba (possibly a variety of coconut or palm tree), and papaya.

prisoner sentenced for murder, escaped. All Dayak houses down river were warned and he was recaptured by Tuai Rumah Sabang and seven followers at Nanga Melipis on the 29th. It is almost certain that lie was helped with food by someone in the Bleti where the Kheh colony exists and inquiries are being made. The reward of $50 has been paid out to Tuai Rumah Sabang. On the 6th at about midnight an outbreak of fire occurred in Kapit bazaar but fortunately it was discovered in time and extinguished. It appears to have been a deliberate attempt to burn the bazaar by putting burning kajangs under the kaki lima, but no clue has been found as to the culprit. Early in the month meetings of down river Tuai Rumah were held at Kanowit in order to fix a date for this year's burns. It is considered that, if an agreement could be reached whereby all padi farmers within prescribed areas would bum within a fixed period, the chances of damage by pest would be considerably diminished. Although the results of the meetings were not altogether satisfactory it is felt that a move has been made in the right direction, and it is thought that next year some more definite arrangement will be possible. During the month Mr. Ong Kee Hui of the Agri¬ cultural Department paid a visit to Kanowit in connection with the proposed experimental padi plot. Subsequently inspector Brahim was per¬ manently transferred to Kanowit. The result of this experiment will be watched with the keenest interest, and it is hoped that it will do much, not only to instruct the natives in modem methods of padi cultivation, but also to demonstrate to them the readiness of the Government to assist them in improving the conditions under which they live. After consultation with the Penghulus in the Nanga Meluan district , various building sites for the recently returned batak’d Dayaks have been settled, and the decisions have on the whole been favourably received by the Dayaks concerned. While the District Officer. Nanga Meluan, has been travelling a great deal of time has been devoted to a full explanation of rubber assessment, and the greatest difficulty has been found in persuading Dayaks that the new legislation was not a revenue collecting movement. In the past Government inspection and survey of rubber has generally meant some new form of taxation, and it is not surprising therefore that the Dayaks regard assessment with some misgiving. The epidemic of gastric influenza in the Nanga Meluan continues and many deaths have occurred. Dressers paid visits to the Ngemah and the Poi districts and as a result of prompt treatment many cases recovered. In Mukah three Dayaks were convicted of tuba fishing in small ditches in the jungle and sentenced to one month’s rigorous imprisonment each in default of payment of fine. A burglar attempted to enter the wireless station at Mukah at night, but the operator woke up when the man was in the act of opening a window and the latter fled. Unfortunately he left no clue beyond a common pocket-knife, which bore some excellent finger prints. These, however, unfortunately turned out to belong to the constable who was first on the spot and who very foolishly gripped the knife firmly in his palm. One case of theft of sago from a sago godown was reported in Oya. Chan Seng Kok was arrested, but, as there was not sufficient evidence against him to warrant a conviction, he was acquitted. The amount of raw sago exported from the Oya district during June was 261 koyans. Compared with the exports for May this shows a decrease of 45 koyans. On the morning of the 6th Native Officer Awang Bunyok reported in Oya that Kam bin Meraoh, aged 6, of Kampong Tanam had been drowned. At a subsequent inquest a verdict of death by drown¬ ing was recorded. Mukah Agricultural Show. PROCLAMATION DAY, 1937. As this show was started principally to encourage agricultural pursuits, (and at the same time, arts crafts, native industries and activities of all kinds) excerpts from a report on it by Mr. Ong Kee Hui, Agricultural Assistant, are given below. It may be of interest, however, if a brief descrip¬ tion is given of the various diversions (of a secondary nature) which were designed to attract the unbucolic (in the hope of bucolicizing them), and to prevent the definitely bucolic from taking themselves and their pumpkins and whatnots, too seriously. The proceedings opened on the evening of May 22nd with the final of the football competition, in which 8 teams competed, the final being between the Crusaders Team and one representing Sarawak Oilfields, Ltd., staff at Matedeng—the latter winning by 1 goal to nil and receiving custody, as the champion for the year, of a very handsome shield presented by Messrs. Ban Lee & Co., of Mukah. The interest in football locally is proved by the enormous crowds which gathered at each of the preliminary matches, which were spread over a period of about two months. The next day 420 exhibits including vegetables, produce, fruit,

Q: What was the outcome of the Mukah Agricultural Show in terms of encouraging agricultural pursuits and native industries?
A: The outcome of the Mukah Agricultical Show for encouraging agricultural pursuits and native industries can be inferred from Mr. Ong Kee Hui's report, although specific details are not provided in the given text. Since the show was started with the primary purpose to encourage these activities, it is likely that there were positive results based on the number of exhibits (420) which included vegetables, produce, and fruit. The diverse range of displays indicates an active participation from local farmers and artisans, suggesting a potential increase in interest towards agricultural pursuits and native industries among the community. Additionally, the various diversions designed to attract both unbucolic and bucolic individuals aimed at creating a fun atmosphere while promoting these activities.

A man was charged nt Sheffield Police Court yesterday with using obscene language to a clockwork mouse which refused to perform on the pavement.— Manchester Guardian. *He has done a lot.—ED. First Division News. JANUARY. Fifty-seven civil and sixty-eight criminal cases came before the Kuching Courts during January. Of the hitter, twenty-two were for breaches of Municipal bye-laws. At an inquest into the death of a Chinese, named Chong Ah Ann, who was run over and killed by a lorry, a verdict of accidental death duo to negligence on the part of the lorry driver was recorded. The lorry driver was subsequently charged with "Causing death by a rash act" under section 301A of the Sarawak Penal Code, found guilty, and fined $50. Compensation to the value of $200 was awarded to the widow of deceased. The Assistant District Officer, Mr. G. F. J. Pegler, proceeded to Lundu by m.l. Betty on January 28th, and was still away at the end of the month. The man who was found wandering along the coast in the vicinity of Telok Sarabang during December has now been identified. While under observation in the General Hospital, he was recognized as a son of Amat bin Merah of Kampong Main. Kuching. According to the latter, his son left Kuching nine years ago intending to sail to Miri. While off Kuala Baram, the boat was wrecked, and it was then thought there were no survivors. Inquiries have, however, failed to elicit any information as to the son's whereabouts and mode of existence since his original departure from Kuching. Seventy logs of kruik wood were shipped from Lundu to Kuching during the month. The District Officer, Serian and Samarahan, reports that Kampong Lobang Batu lost their share Sunong Belabor as they failed to arrive on the day appointed for gathering. The nests were brought to Seriab by the Native Officer and people from Kampong Semabang, and sent for miction to Kuching, where a very much better price was obtained than any offers made locally. During the District Officer’s visit to the Ulu Sadong this month he tried to persuade the owners of birdsnests' caves to bring the nests to him, and told them that he would have them auctioned in Kuching and obtain better prices for them. All owners of caves in the Ulu Sadong have large debts to Chinese traders at Serian. who give them low prices and exchange provisions for the nests. Two band Dayaks were fined according to Land Dayak custom for taking on a second wife before divorcing the first. Kampong Mentu had a land dispute with Kampong Lobang Batu in which Lobang Batu people were found to be preparing to farm this year in Mentu land. The harvest of 1935 failed badly in the Ulu Sadong, with the result that all Kampongs except Temong and Koran have been living on krebang and bandong for some months. The Dayaks, however, have taken a stoic view of the failure of the rice crop, and no complaints or requests for Government assistance have been received. The fruit season, however, has again been fairly good in parts. The padi all over the Serian district is very good, and in the Ulu Sadong will be ready for harvesting during February. At Mentong, Mayang and Mentu the Dayaks have a system of irrigation : the low-lying land is flooded a month after they have planted out their padi by partly damming up the small streams traversing that land. They thereby turn empran hind into swamp, but nt the same time keep a stream of fresh water running through their farm. This flooding obviates the necessity of weeding, and it has been noticed that the padi in these three districts is really excellent. Some of the Serian traders have started to erect their shophouses in the new bazaar. The Kuching- Simanggang Road on the Kuching side of the Samarahan bridge has recently been very bad, and at the end of the month there was no rice, kerosene oil. tobacco or salt left in the bazaar. From the Samarahan to Serian the road is passable, and so some traders have been having their stores sent by boat from Kuching through Loba Blat to the Samarahan, and then brought from there by lorry. No motor cars have been able to get through for six weeks.

Q: What is Evelyn Van Pippen's unique characteristic that involves her tongue?
A: Evelyn Van Pippen has had her tongue bored as though for earrings, and now sports a collection of jewelry on the end of it. This makes it difficult for her to eat in an ordinary way or speak but she is learning the deaf and dumb alphabet and making arrangements to receive nourishment through a tube.

The Food Control Department was severely taxed to supply the population with rice during the month The irregularity of supplies arriving from Singapore was the chief cause of the difficulty.
   It was found necessary for the Government to take over the sale of rice to Dayaks as stocks were getting so low and at limes, during the month, it was necessary to substitute raw sago for rice.
   A large quantity of sago was purchased at Daro and shipped to Sibu in the Government launches and distributed as necessity arose.
   The Food Controller in Kuching forwarded 300 bags of rice by the s.s. Gladys, on the 7th, and further consignments, per H. H. S. Y. Zahora, on the 17th and 21st, which helped to tide over the difficulties until the arrival of the s.s. Gladys from Singapore, on the 24th.
   A further consignment of rice was received by the s.s Plevo, on the 30th, which rendered the situation normal.
   Mr. H. D. Aplin, in charge of the Food Control Department, and his clerk. A. Mowe, are to be congratulated on their tactful management of a difficult situation. The patience of the native population on considerably reduced rations was exemplary.
   In consequence of a message from His Majesty the King, forwarded by His Highness the Tuan Muda, requiring that all loyal subjects should at 11 a.m., on the 11th instant, set apart two minutes “to perpetuate the memory of that great deliverance and of those who laid down their lives to achieve it” a gun was fired from the Fort, at the appointed time, and all operations in the station ceased.
   Mr. G. M. Gifford arrived from Kapit on the 7th in order to discuss various Dayak and Kayan affairs and returned on the 13th.
   Mr W. R. Tudor Clement, having settled all outstanding cases at Matu and Rejang, returned to Sibu early in the month.
   On the 14th, a Malay named Mohamat was taken by a crocodile at tanjong Tekap, near Binatang. The relations and friends of deceased made every effort to
catch the reptile and were successful in securing it some fourteen days later.
   Subject to His Highness the Rajah's approval Pangeran Gusli Mohamat Yassim was appointed Tuah Kampong at Selalang. Previous to this appointment there had been no recognised Tuah Kampong at this village, but, owing to the numbers of Malays now settled at Selalang, it was found-necessary to have a native official representative.
   From the 15th to the 2lst I was absent from the station on a visit to Mukah and Oya.
   Mr. E. O. Bruce arrived per the H. H. S. Y. Zahora, on the 21st, having been appointed to do duty at Sibu.
   The Revd. Father Halder, Rector of Sibu, left for a well earned long leave, after eighteen years work in the Sarawak Mission. The whole community will look forward with pleasure to his return.
   A number of applications were made for a small piece of land, in the vicinity of the wharf, for the purpose of erecting a store.
   The land was auctioned and went to the highest bidder Messrs Soon Seng & Co. for $760.
   H. H. S. Y. Zahora made two trips to Sibu during the month.
   The s.s. Alice Lorraine called once bringing a cargo of coal for the use of the Government launches.
   The s.s. Flevo made the usual two trips to and from Singapore and the s.s. Gladys cleared twice, but only brought one cargo direct from Singapore.

J. BARING-GOULD,
                  Resident 3rd Division
OYA.

October, 1919.
   
   General. — Mr. H. L. Owen arrived from Mukah on the 3rd and left again on the 11th.
   On the 6th I accompanied Mr. Owen to Dalat returning together to Oya on the 9th.
   Pangeran Mohamat, Native Officer, resumed his seat again on the bench on the 15th after an absence of over a month and a half.
   Penghulu Umpieng was in Oya towards the end of the month. He had nothing to say and had brought down no fines. His objects in coming down-river appeared to be to defend an action for debt brought against him in the Sibu Court of Requests and to try and purchase a dozen guns.
   I left for Dalat again on the 26th returning to Oya on the last day of the month.
   A tuba fishing took place at Dalat on the 30th and was continued on the following two days. There were over six hundred boats on the river and the natives kept the three days as a holiday.

Q: What measures did the Food Control Department take to ensure rice supply during the month, and how did the native population react?
A: During the month, the Food Control Department faced difficulties in supplying rice due to irregularities in supplies arriving from Singapore. To address this issue, the government took over the sale of rice to Dayaks as stocks were getting low. In some instances, raw sago was substituted for rice when necessary. A large quantity of sago was purchased at Daro and shipped to Sibu in government launches before being distributed as needed. The Food Controller in Kuching forwarded additional consignments of rice on various dates which helped tide over the difficulties until further supplies arrived from Singapore. The native population's reaction to these reduced rations was exemplary, demonstrating great patience and understanding during this challenging time.

Obituary Notices. HUMPHREYS. His Excellency J. L. Humphreys, Governor of B. N.B., whose tragic death occurred at Tientsin last December, will be remembered here for the short visit be paid to Kuching not long before going on leave last year. We quote the following leader from our contemporary—the BN.B. Herald of 2nd January— which was received too late for insertion in our last issue.
DEATH OF HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR.
It is with profound regret that the death of His Excellency the Governor, which occurred at Tientsin on the afternoon of Sunday, 15th December, is recorded.
His Excellency left North Borneo on furlough on 26th September with the intention of visiting the Netherlands East Indies, Hong Kong, China, Japan and the United States of America on his way home to England. After visiting Bali, Java, Hong Kong, Canton and Shanghai he intended to proceed to Peking, Mukden and Korea and to sail from Yokohama for America in the latter part of December.
His Excellency wrote from Shanghai on 18th November and was evidently in good health, having won the Open Golf Championship of China on the two preceding days ; he had arranged to leave by boat for Tientsin on 19th November ; it must have been after this date that he contracted the pneumonia which proved fatal.
The first intimation that reached North Borneo was a cable from London, received on 28th November, stating that His Excellency was critically ill with pneumonia in hospital at Tientsin; the course of his severe illness has been closely followed with the deepest sympathy by the whole com-munity, whose one hope was for his recovery.
John I.isseter Humphreys was a Senior Classical Scholar of Brasenose College, Oxford, where he obtained a First Class in Classical Moderations in 1902. In 1905 he joined the Civil Service of the Straits Settlements where his ability quickly won recognition ; in 1915 after ten years' service he was appointed to act as British Agent, Trengganu. For over nine years the State of Trengganu had the advantage of developing under his able	
administration and on two occasions his exceptional services were recognised by the Secretary of State; in 1919 the appointment of British Agent, Trengganu, was raised to the rank of British Adviser, Trengganu and in 1924 the post of British Adviser, Trengganu was made a Staff appointment. In 1925 Mr. Humphreys was transferred to act as British Adviser, Kedah, and in September, 1926, as Staff Officer of the rank of British Adviser, Kedah, he was seconded as Governor of the State of North Borneo.	
In 1925 he became a Commander of the British Empire and in 1928, while Governor of North Borneo, the Companionship of St. Michael and St. George was bestowed on him.
His death at the early age of 48 years, in the full vigour of exceptional intellectual faculties, is deplored by all; evidence of his marked abilities as an administrator can already be seen, and North Borneo will increasingly benefit in future years from the knowledge, wisdom and experience that he brought to bear upon the problems of this State. Those who came in contact with him could not fail to realise the personality and power that lay within him; by his straightforward and unaffected character he gained the affection of those who knew him and served him ; he never spared himself in his work; he loved his country.
Just as he was eminent in his work so he succeeded in all that gained his attention; he had a great range of interests; he was a deep reader with a wide knowledge of many subjects; he was an admirable host; he was always ready to take part in all forms of sport, but at golf, his game, he excelled.
While all mourn the untimely passing of one who must take a pre-eminent place in the history of North Borneo, to many there is an added grief in the loss of a great friend.
PRATT-BARLOW.
From home papers we learn that the death occurred on 6th January, at the Forbes Fraser Hospital, Bath, of Ethel, widow of the late George Pratt-Barlow, after a long illness most patiently borne. It will be recalled that her husband, who died at 18 Rivers Street, Bath, in May 1928, was for 28 years in the Sarawak Civil Service, during nearly all of which time he was stationed in the Third Division, mostly at Mukah, Bintulu, and the Lower Rejang. He retired on pension in May .1906, and settled in Bath where for five years he acted as Secretary to the Bath and County Club, and later served as a Special Constable during the war.
GOMPERTZ. 	
Reuter cables news from London of the death on 8th February, of Sir Henry Hessey Johnston Gompertz, who retired from the Chief-Justiceship of the Federated Malay States last year.

Q: What were some notable positions held by His Excellency J. L. Humphreys before becoming Governor of North Borneo?
A: Before becoming Governor of North Borneo, His Excellency John Isaacsetter Humphreys held several significant positions in the Straits Settlements Civil Service and British administration. He was appointed as a British Agent for Trengganu in 1915 after quickly winning recognition for his abilities. In 1919, the appointment of British Agent, Trengganu was raised to the rank of British Adviser, Trengganu due to his exceptional services. In 1924, the post of British Adviser, Trengganu became a Staff appointment. Humphreys then served as British Adviser for Kedah in 1925 and later as Staff Officer of the rank of British Adviser for Kedah before being seconded to act as Governor of North Borneo in September 1926.

The material progress of a nation depends on its enormous industry and the vast improvement in agric ulture. Compulsory educations and the higher education in various branches of science give them the light of wisdom and the power. The all industriousness of the people with less heed to luxury raises the standard of economy and gives prosperity. Widemindedness is the only way for unity which is strength to us.

Mary Hoover.
The other day there left Sarawak, not to return, one of those outstanding people who from time to time appear for some years and then leave us the poorer for their loss.
In February, 1935, the Reverend J. M. Hoover, "Jim" Hoover in this part of the world, died. The newspapers wrote fully of his life in Sarawak, stressing not only his piety but the practical side of his teaching. He was a Sarawak "worthy” and in all his work he was supported and encouraged by his wife.
Mary Hoover came to Sarawak as a bride in 1904 and went to live with her husband at the little leaf attap-roofed Mission near Sungei Merab at Sibu. Jim Hoover had arrived in March of the previous year, and now between them they started the activities of their Mission.
The progress of that Methodist Mission is new Sarawak history. Its churches, chapels and schools spread from Kapit to Sarikei, and members of that sect are to be found in all parts of the Third Division.
To Mary Hoover fell mostly the education of the girls, and it is true to say that now up and down the Rejang there are hundreds of Chinese women who remember with gratitude her loving teaching and kindness. To have attended her school in Sibu was a mark of distinction, and it was said that the ambition of many a young Chinese lad was to get one of her “old girls” as a bride.
Mrs. Hoover was well qualified to be a mentor. She spoke Chinese fluently and I have never heard a European woman talk better Malay. She surprised us by her knowledge of Tamil and she could converse easily with any strolling Dayak. She was a strict disciplinarian but behind her sometimes formidable manner one could detect kindness and sympathy for all who turned to her for help or advice.
It is surprising that she was not better known in other parts of the country, but her work was all done in or about Sibu and she was not a woman to court publicity. Jim Hoover himself was an Honorary Doctor of his University long before by chance we heard of it, and he was the only non- Government man who has had the Sarawak Long Service Decoration conferred upon him. Mary Hoover’s reward is the affection of the people among whom she worked so long.
On the death of her husband in 1935 she left for Malaya where she did Missionary work. In 1946, however, in spite of her age she volunteered to come back to Sibu for a year in order to get matters going again after the war. It was evident that if anyone could do it she was that person. She has now completed her task and leaves us for good.
Mary Hoover deserves well of Sarawak. She is one of that sisterhood of noble women who put the welfare and interests of the women of Sarawak first in their earthly lives. Some of them come to my mind : Mother Helen, Miss Olger and Miss Cubitt who are dead; Miss Andrews, Mother Clare and Mother Bernadine who still continue their work.
O.F.
The Gentle Art of Singing.
The undoubted popularity of the performance by the S.M.S. Ladies Sextet at the Sarawak Club Concert on August 3rd leads one to hope that the future may sec a large Choral Section of the Music Society as an established fact.
It may not be generally known that quite a number of big Choral Societies started life as small Female Choirs, the reason being that women and girls are, generally speaking, less self-conscious than men. This was particularly instanced in the difference between the drill of men and women forces during the war. The average men feels be is making a fool of himself by being smart, the girls think they are “just the stuff." However, in the choral way, men usually drift in after a while and once they get the thrill of singing with a big choir persuade others to join and so the Choral gets started. It is hoped that this will happen in Sarawak. The title of this article is a crib from that grand old man of music. Sir Henry Wood, the man who did more few music in England than any other composer, conductor or producer. It will be noticed that he calls singing an “Art” not a “gift.”

Q: What was Mary Hoover's significant contribution to Sarawak and how did her influence impact the community?
A: Mary Hoover made a significant contribution to Sarawak by starting and expanding the Methodist Mission, which spread from Kapit to Sarikei. She focused mostly on educating girls and was well-qualified as she spoke Chinese fluently, Malay, Tamil, and could converse with Dayaks. Her influence impacted the community in a positive way, earning her the affection of the people and leaving behind hundreds of grateful Chinese women who remembered her loving teaching and kindness.

Sad Drowning Case in Kuching.
A distressing affair happened on the 23rd when a young Chinese bicyclist Chan Seo Seug, in attempting to pass a bullock cart on the old wooden bridge near the late Customs Offices, fell off the bridge machine and all, into the river and was drowned.
The bullock-cart driver drove on and none of the Chinese who saw the affair made any attempt at a rescue. About half an hour later an Indian named Makbul Khan, employed at the Government Monopolies Offices, attracted by the crowd, appeared on the scene and pluckily dived in. He managed to locate both the body and the bicycle.
This bridge is in a most dilapidated condition, and for some time has been unsafe for the amount of traffic it takes every day. The rails have disappeared and at one place part of the deck has partially blocked the passage.
A pathetic episode occurred a short while after the affair when deceased’s grandmother visited the spot and threw herself into the river, from which she was rescued with difficulty.
Deceased, who was only 18 years old, was the sole support of his mother and grandmother.
Sarawak and the Navy.
With the recent visit of H.M.S. Herald to the Kuching district, it is thought that readers of the Sarawak Gazette might be interested in a brief survey of the warships which have visited this district during the last sixty years.
The earlier visitation of warships are too well known to need any repetition here; accounts of their visits may be found in any history of Sarawak or in any Life of Sir James Brooke
My object, is to bring to light the numerous vessels, comparatively unknown, which have made calls here during the times of the late and present Rajahs.
This note does not profess to be absolutely accurate, and lack of adequate reference books makes comment on the earlier vessels rather difficult.
The list is divided into two parts, British and Foreign.
“Black and White” Football
Trophy 1929.
The first replay between the Police and Steamship Company, took place on the 30th July and
ended in another draw, no goals being scored, but in the next replay the Steamship Company made
no mistake about it. winning by four goals to nil.
in a team which twice held its own against the
superior combination of the Steamship Company,
and kept pegging at it when down a goal or two
in the last game, it is invidious to single out
individual players for praise but we cannot pass
on without commenting on the display given by
the Police goalkeeper. It was due in a great
measure to him that the team got through the
first two games and he had bad luck in being
beaten four times in the third one Their Captain Anis deserves praise for the way he handled
his team and all who saw these games remarked
on the difference in “tactics” from previous years.
The Police should persevere with the team they
have and improve their combination and they
will be a difficult nut to crack when the next
competition comes along
The Municipal and Treasury Rangers game was hardly up to the standard of the previous
matches. None the less the Municipal and Treasury deserve credit for the stand they put up
against the fast and skillful team the Rangers
had out, and one goal for them would not have
been out of running with the play. However, a
goal never came their way and they had to retire
with a score of 4-0 against them.
The first semi-final between the Medical and
Health and European Merchants resulted in a win
for the Medical and Health by one goal to nil The
shot which counted was a long dropping one from
the wing which the goalkeeper misjudged slightly
and allowed to glance off his hands into the net
(a question mark after the last word Mr. Printer
please). This game, although some good football
was played, was not so exciting as most of the
others, due probably to the slower movements of
the Merchants. Their forwards seldom got a chance of getting properly away and got no
support from the wing halves who were the
weak spots in a fairly good team, and were never
up to take a clearance when the forwards were
pressing. The Medical and Health were an improved combination and the bustling work done
by their right half had a lot to do with their victory. The spectators showed their appreciation of the good-natured way he took hefty thuds and gave them.
The other semi-final between the Rangers and
Steamship Company was a ding-dong game all
the way through. Right from the start the teams
went at it for all they were worth and both
keepers were tested various times. The Rangers,
by passing high, managed to get in touch with
their opponents goalkeeper oftener than the Steamship, whose ground passing nearly always got
trapped by an opponent, and the lusty kicking
of the Rangers defence soon cleared their lines.
The game continued to be evenly contested and
both keepers were kept on the go and it was not
until almost half time that Corporal Ismail slipped
past three of his opponents to score

Q: What happened to Chan Seo Seug, the young Chinese bicyclist?
A: Chan Seo Seug, a young Chinese bicyclist, tragically drowned after falling off an old wooden bridge near the late Customs Offices while attempting to pass a bullock cart. None of the witnesses or Chinese bystanders made any attempt at rescue until an Indian named Makbul Khan, employed at the Government Monopolies Offices, bravely dove in and located both the body and the bicycle half an hour later.

And of course there are many more. They may roughly be divided into two categories—those which appeal to the local races and those which remain practically exclusively a European preserve. Amongst the latter must regretfully be classed the game of cricket. Fifty years ago it was different. The pages of the old Sarawak Gazette reveal that Asiatics often took a leading part in local cricket matches and the Gazette of July 1st, 1897, records a great victory by one run of the "R.C. School" over their rivals the "S.P.G. School." Why has that skill and keenness disappeared? Only a handful of Chinese turn out for cricket nowadays with possibly one or two Malays. That is in Kuching. We do not know what is happening elsewhere but the cricket team of the pre-war M.R.C. in Miri, consisting mostly of Indians, was as good as the G.C.M. In Kuching European supremacy has been long unchallenged. And yet in a match played on August 1st, 1896, on the Fort ground between Kuching and H.M.S. Porpoise the former team included Snabong, Lance-Corporal Aise, Bandsman Api, Sergeant Kasim, Bandsman Seman, and Lance-Corporal Ahit, and we read in the Gazette that "Api, who filled the vacancy to- gether with Aise, began to bat in most spirited style and drove the Marine bowling all over the field." The glory has departed! Perhaps it is because matches are now played in the glaring heat of the noon-day sun instead of, as then, in the cool of the evening, and those who are not Englishmen do not see why they should lay them- selves open to the charge of being mad dogs. Perhaps Constabulary or Rangers’ discipline in those days required a certain proficiency at the most respectable of games. More probably, how- ever, the explanation is to be found in the enormous popularity of soccer.
Soccer is essentially the game of the proletariat. In certain localities in the United Kingdom, the "West Country" for example, rugger may be able to attract bigger crowds, but over the greater part of the land thousands of people turn up to watch the local soccer team, while the ex-public school- boys, in the next field but one, exercise themselves amidst empty spaces. The increasing popularity of soccer has both contributed to, and been assisted by, the breaking down of class barriers. Nowadays
it is almost as possible to play soccer and still be a gentleman as it is to be a respectable member of society and not be a gentleman. And yet there is something radically wrong with it. The last page of the Straits Times has recently been prolific with comments concerning the bad spirit in which certain games have been conducted in Malaya. But let it not be thought that this is a purely local evil. Deliberate fouling is no doubt exceptional, but the dishonest "appeal" when the manoeuvre has been lost, the ragging of the referee, the blind partisanship of spectators, seem to be typical of soccer wherever it is played, or at least wherever it is played by people who are not gentlemen. Far be it from us to decry soccer. Its popularity is the test of its worth, but it is up to those who brought it to the East to discourage its more disreputable manifestations to every extent in their power.
Well ahead of other games soccer has made great strides in the hinterland, in spite of the "boots or no boots" controversy which crops up from time to time. To a large degree it is learned and encouraged under the watchful eyes of the adminis- trative officers which is all to the good. We remember that some years ago a District Officer, who was refereeing a match in an outstation, was so scandalised by a particular piece of rough play that he blew his whistle, stopperl the game, grabbed the two offenders and marched them off to the local gaol, where they spent the night, emerging next morning, it is to be hoped, wiser and better plavers.

Q: What factors could have contributed to the decline of cricket's popularity among non-European communities in Kuching?
A: The text suggests that several factors might have led to the decline of cricket's popularity among non-European communities, particularly Asiatics and Malays, in Kuching. These include a shift in match timings from evening games to matches played during noon-day sun, which could make playing uncomfortable for those not used to it; the enormous popularity of soccer that might have drawn attention away from cricket; and potentially, changes in discipline requirements within Constabulary or Rangers' teams. The text also implies that European supremacy in cricket may have discouraged non-European communities from participating due to possible accusations of being "mad dogs."

Bau Gold.
The owner of a gold mine must, in these hard times, excite a certain amount of interest, although perhaps the Bau workings are hardly mines in the accepted sense of the word.
If one announced in Europe that one owned a gold mine, one would be expected to stay at the Ritz, wear a diamond tiepin and smoke expensive cigars. Most people would imagine vast vaults in the bowels of the earth from which sparkling nuggets could be picked for casual presentation to visitors, as souvenirs. This is a quite erroneous idea. Strange as it may seem to the uninitiated, the present writer recently visited a portion of the gold workings at Sabulan, Bau, but not a speck of gold was seen. The method employed to extract the gold, the cyanide process, will be familiar to many “old stagers” but it may be sufficiently unfamiliar to be of interest to many others, as it was to the writer of this account.
Having come by light car over n few miles of very narrow road, we eventually arrived at the base of some limestone hills, a locality known as Sabulan. Descending from the car we climbed up through a narrow defile and emerged in a rather imposing natural arena, surrounded on all sides by limestone cliffs some 300 ft. in height; at the farther end of this arena, about 200 yards distant were the sheds and buts sheltering the plant.
Half way up the steep cliff several men, looking like flies on a wall, could be seen and from this direction there came, at regular intervals, a rattling smashing roar. We were to learn the cause of this later.
An overseer conducted us up a perilous goat track on to a small ledge where several coolies feverishly shovelled a very rich brown soil into trucks. This was the gold ore which came rushing and hurtling down a long shoot into which it was thrown by the men we had seen from afar high up on the cliff face.
Several tons were let loose down the shoot at one load and were “braked” at the bottom, near which we stood, by a large sheet of metal, hence the intermittent roar we had heard on emerging from the defile.
We vainly gazed at the out hoping to see bits of gold sticking out here and there but we were sadly disappointed!
In one ton of ore the amount of gold collected, even from high yielding ore, would scarce cover the famous Kruschen six-pence.
This ore is carried along a pier in trucks and lipped into a storage room.
Below this, at the base of the cliff stood a long shed in which were some twenty concrete vats, each about 15 feet square, in which many hundreds of tons of the ore were “slewing.” When the vat is full of ore, a large pipe at the top of each vat discharges cyanide solution into the vat until the ore is submerged. It then stays there for some days what time the cyanide absorbs and takes the gold out of the ore into solution.
The gold bearing solution is eventually released by a pipe at the base of the vat and allowed to flow into secondary tanks at a lower level. In these tanks trays full of zinc filings are suspended.
A further chemical action now takes place between the gold solution and the zinc filings; the gold being deposited on the zinc which is in due course carted away and separated from the gold by heating in a kiln.
When this operation is complete out flows the gold and there we are. No wonder it is so expensive.
The amount of gold worked per month at Bidi and Sabulan is said to be about 600 ounces. This is worth about $20,000. Of course, the depreciation of the pound sterling recently gave a considerable extra profit to a concern of this kind.
It should be explained that the majority of gold workers in this district are using old “tailings” or waste ore thrown up by the Borneo Company in their gold working days.
At that time apparently it was not considered worth while working ore of less than a certain penny weight yield per ton owing to the size of plant and scale of the working. Most of these “tailings” therefore were thrown up but not completely worked out. It was all extremely interesting to a stranger to the district, in spite of the fact that not one grain of gold was seen the whole time.

Q: What was the process used at Sabulan, Bau for extracting gold and how does it differ from what "old stagers" might be familiar with?
A: At Sabulan, Bau, the method employed to extract gold involves the cyanide process. Although this may be unfamiliar to many people, it is also known and used by "old stagers," or experienced individuals in the industry. The ore is first shoveled into trucks and then hurled down a long shoot where it is slowed down using a large sheet of metal at the bottom. This ore is carried along a pier into storage rooms before being transferred to concrete vats, each about 15 feet square. When these vats are full, cyanide solution is discharged from a pipe at the top until the ore is submerged. The gold-bearing solution is eventually released and allowed to flow into secondary tanks where trays of zinc filings are suspended. A chemical reaction occurs between the gold solution and the zinc filings, causing the gold to deposit on the zinc. After this process, the gold can be separated from the zinc by heating in a kiln.

One of the most notable features of the last two and a half years has been the amount and variety of manual skill and mechanical genius that hard times have evoked. Adversity" doffs its hat with respect, gratitude, and astonishment to the men who make stoves and ovens; who erect pumps and repair taps: who induce watches that expired with freedom to rise and resume the march: who restore sight to the blind by performing miracles with broken spectacles: who produce models from mud- holes. and musical instruments from refuse dumps; who both know how to grow vegetables and actually grow them; who concoct tasty dishes from materials that were never equalled in any night- mare of Mrs. Beaton's, and skin goats as if they were born to be window-dressers in a ladies' emporium; who, in short, realise that their hands were given them for other purposes besides blowing their noses and picking their teeth. They are the men of the hour, the men who make incarceration tolerable for their fellows, and without whom it is difficult to see how life could survive. But what of the others? What of that great, flabby. amorphous mass of creatures, who find much difficulty in making a stool with four legs of equal length all of which come out on the same side, who put the blades of their changkols on upside down, and stick latex patches on their trousers with such energy that they have to be extricated from their garments with a hammer and chisel before retiring
to bed. They cannot now point with paternal pride to the children of their inventive brain and mechanical dexterity, nor will they be able, in after years, to donate acceptable exhibits to the war prisoners’ museum. To this useless, helpless, but somehow pitiable class of men “Adversity" offers a solution. If they cannot manipulate a saw or wield a saucepan, they can at any rate use a pen or pencil and thus find a vent for their fertile imaginations and fervent memories; and perhaps one day a stranger will turn the pages of their articles and stories, and conclude that they too were men, who refused to allow prolonged misfortune and recurring disappointment to blunt their energies or stagnate their brains.
We do not, however, wish to convey the impression that we are merely offering a kind of consolation prize to the manually inept. On the contrary many of our most valued contributors are members of that superior class whose abilities we applaud. There is ample room between our covers for all sorts and conditions of authors. It has been represented to the Editorial Board that “Adversity” should have a more topical flavour. The point is arguable. On the one hand there is the natural desire of everyone to turn their minds away from our present trials and seek refreshment in more congenial pastures, while, on the other, it does seem reasonable that a camp magazine should contain some allusion to camp conditions, and the people enduring them, particularly if, in the future, it. is to present any picture at all of our life and times. The Board has decided, therefore, that, while it in no way wishes to discourage the authors of short stories or articles on subjects more directly connected with the great world outside the bars, it would particularly welcome contributions dealing with the daily round. At present the magazine lacks a correspondence column and a gossip column, as well as a series of contentious articles raising the various points, which are so perpetually eubjected to oral discussion and debate. So long as the law of defamation, the conventions of society, and the susceptibilities of the gods are properly observed there would appear to be a wide and untilled field for potential writers to experiment in.

Q: What does "Adversity" offer as a solution for those who struggle with manual skills during hard times?
A: For individuals who find difficulty in developing manual skills or mechanical dexterity during hard times, "Adversity" offers them an opportunity to use their pen or pencil and express themselves through writing. They can share their fertile imaginations and fervent memories by contributing articles or stories, allowing others to appreciate their intellect despite the challenges they face in other areas of life.

A scheme has been approved, and $118,000 provided, for a survey of the fisheries of Sarawak over a period of two years. Mr. E. Banks, who has had long experience of this country and is known to most of you, will conduct the survey. He is undergoing a course of training in certain technical aspects of his work and is expected to arrive and begin work early in the new year. He will be assisted by a master fisherman who will investigate the possibility of employing power methods and of improving fishing technique in waters near Sarawak. The survey is a necessary preliminary to the preparation of plans to help the fishermen of Sarawak. Amongst other things that will be investigated, is the possibility of producing fish meal locally, both a high grade edible meal and a lower grade meal for agricultural use.
Two further schemes which have been approved are shared jointly with North Borneo and Brunei. One is a scheme for a Malarial Research Survey of the three territories over a period of 3 years. From this survey it is hoped to obtain sufficient inform- ation about the causation and incidence of malaria in British Borneo to enable the most effective measures to be taken to deal with this menace.
The other joint scheme covers a period of 4 years and is a Scholarship Scheme to enable residents in Borneo territories to obtain the qualifications necessary for appointment or promotion to the higher grades of the public service. A sum of $42,000 has been provided for this purpose. Un- fortunately, owing to the low educational standards pervailing here as a result of the Japanese occupation, there are at the moment very few prospective candidates possessing sufficiently high educational qualifications to take advantage of this scheme. When the Batu Lintang secondary school has been in operation for a couple of years, it is hoped that a satisfactory number of candidates will be forthcoming.
I have mentioned only those schemes which have been approved and on which work has alreadv started or is about to start. Action is being taken in connection with the other schemes, which I described to you in May last, for the development of our agricultural resources and the improvement of communications. I shall hope to be able to report further progress at your next meeting.
Sarawak has had the benefit of visits from a number of experts who have studied local conditions and given us practical and helpful advice. They
have come from the Colonial Office, the staff of the Governor-General, that of the Special Commissioner, from the British Council, the United Nations Secretariat and elsewhere. Three technical advisers to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who deal with medical and health affairs, with surveys and with fisheries, were particularly helpful. It is in large part due to their assistance that it has been possible to make an early start on the develop- ment schemes which fall within their spheres. It is fashionable in certain quarters to complain about the interference of Whitehall in local colonial affairs, its failure to protect local interests and its ignorance of local conditions. Sarawak has good reason to be grateful for the personal study of local conditions made by the Secretary of State's advisers, for the sympathetic interest taken in its affairs by the Colonial Office and for the prompt, practical and generous measure of assistance it has received not only from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund but in the matter of urgently needed supplies of all kinds and in many other ways. Sarawak and its people have benefited very considerably from the fact that it is a full member of the Colonial Empire.
I do not propose in this address to give a detailed review of the activities of the various departments of Government during the year. I have referred to some of them, directly or by implication, in my review of the Colony’s financial position and of the developments now being initiated. An annual report of the Colony for 1947 will be published in due course and will contain a full account of them. There are however one or two matters which I feel should be mentioned now.
The trade of the Colony has not so far been markedly affected by the economic crisis through which the United Kingdom and the rest of Western Europe is passing. Some effect there must be and Sarawak, as a member of the sterling bloc, has its small part to play in helping towards recovery. By reducing the consumption of petrol, by restricting the import of luxury or unnecessary articles and ceasing to import goods whose purchase requires gold dollars, by avoiding any unnecessary reduction in the Colony’s surplus funds invested in England, we can help. The greatest help we can give is by increasing production for export, particularly of those commodities, such as rubber and jelutong, which earn gold dollars. Sarawak is doing all these things.

Q: What are the two joint schemes approved with North Borneo and Brunei?
A: The two joint schemes approved with North Borneo and Brunei include a Malarial Research Survey of the three territories over a period of 3 years, aimed at obtaining information about the causation and incidence of malaria in British Borneo to deal effectively with this menace. The other joint scheme covers a period of 4 years and is a Scholarship Scheme to enable residents in Borneo territories to obtain qualifications necessary for appointment or promotion to higher grades of the public service, with $42,000 provided for this purpose.

H urt.
A person is said causing hurt :—
(iii) privation of ear. head or face.
Public Servant.
“Public servant" means any person who by virtue is in actual possession of a public.
Negligence.
“A" is warn by “B” (“B” A's father) not to over use his things, but of which A did not followed . wherefore A is charged as “Negligence."
Public Nuisance.
Public Nuisance is an act which will endanger human life, properties and safety. The offender who commits such offence behave himself foolishly and takes it as nothing, whereas on the hand the public is damn annoyed by such offences or not which are committed by such guilty person.
Complaint.
A person, who is not satisfied to any act com- mitted by another person upon him, or with the knowledge that another person is doing the lawful offence, may report to the authority and calls for justice. This is called a complaint.
Compoundable.
If person are going to blackmarket when entered the blackmarket he saw a Chinese people stelling his hat, and he came up to the office and reported to the Magistrate, but the Magistrate said two of you must be “compoundable."
Unlawful Assembly.
’’Unlawful Assembly” is an Assembly of more than one Persons's normally ten or 30.
Duty Of Magistrate Recording Confession.
When reported by a police stating that an accused wishes to confess his offence to the magistrate. The magistrate before hearing the accused confession must make a letter or certificate or document stating that the accused from such date make a confession on his offence and after that is done a finger-print (left) thumb of the accused must be applied. Then when all was done, the magistrate must dictate every word what the accused had to say.
In Defence of Pusa.
On reading the article "Perentah Peripatetic” in the May issue and the reference therein to "What is the most depressing sub-station in Sarawak?”, I felt inclined to remain silent on the subject and to wait for someone to launch an attack on Pusa. It was then my intention to write and defend that station. Since then, however, it has been my misfortune to spend a night at Sebuyau, without a launch in which to stay, due to the vessel in which I was travelling breaking down between Lingga and Sebuyau. As a result of this enforced visit I feel in a position tn write these few notes to show, by comparison, that Sebuyau is by far a more depressing sub-station than Pusa. To some readers this may appear tn be an impossible statement, but I hope these facts will prove conclusive.
There are probably many who will say that I did not know Sebuyau in the "old days" when there was a pleasant bungalow on top of the hill. This bungalow is no longer there and it is of the Sebuyau and Pusa of to-day that I write. In case the young Native Officer at Sebuyau should chance to read this I hasten to express my appreciation for his very kind hospitality while I was there. It made my short visit almost enjoyable—and woe betide the traveller who should stay there when the Native Officer is absent!
The first point to depress the would-be visitor to Sebuyau is that there are no European quarters provided. The quarters which presumably were intended for European visitors, consisting of two rooms, are now used, one as an office and the other as a dwelling place for one of the policemen stationed there.
If you arrive unexpectedly, and late at night as I did, there will lie a hurried exit of the policeman to some other equally frightful room, where he will spend the night (poor fellow !). The loom normally occupied by him is then at your disposal. I will not harp on the conditions of cleanliness (or other- wise!) that will confront you, but it is what one would expect to find in the circumstances. The outlook from this room, through the one small window provided, is on to the bazaar and river bank—neither a very pleasant sight. The scene in the dapor defies description, but, as usual, your boy will cope with this and make no comment.
One other matter concerning the "European quarters" is worthy of mention. What are the bathing facilities? It is true that Sebuyau has a wonderful supply of fresh water straight from the hill-top and for this reason is the envy of most other sub-stations nearby. But—what bathing facil- ities are there? The answer is "none." If you like "mixed bathing,” amongst the rest of the village who are nearly always there, then you will be fortunate, as fairly close by there is an abundant supply of excellent water. If it should be a wet, dark night, then you will not be so fortunate, and will probably go to bed without your bath.

Q: What does "Public Nuisance" refer to?
A: "Public Nuisance" refers to an act that endangers human life, properties, and safety. The offender who commits such offense behaves foolishly and takes it as nothing, while on the other hand, the public is greatly annoyed by these offenses committed by such guilty persons.

Pada masa saya diam Simanggang saya kerja officer in charge of sago plantations. Mcmang tiada mulong di-Simanggang tetapi itu jam peren- tah harap dapat mulong sana dudi hari dan saya trima hukum sedir dahulu sebab perentah mahu saya terus tangkap itu mulong bila jadi. Ada D.O. sana yang banyak pandai jadi engine telinga. Tiada lalak di-atas nya. Jikalau dia tengok engine jalan dia mahu buka itu engine pereksa apa sebab dia pandai jalan dan jikalau dia tengok engine tidak jalan dia mahu buka itu engirie pereksa apa sebab dia tidak pandai jalan. Sekarang, dalam ini tem- pat Simanggang ada lapan belas barang padam api, bernama ‘Minimax,’ dalam semua rumah perentah. Itu D.O. chakap sama saya: ‘Sekarang Poggy, kita tiada kerja sampai itu mulong bernang sini dari Mukah. Ini pagi towsah kita main fan tan. Saya mahu kita pereksa semua itu barang padam api dan ajar sama orang mata mata bagaimana pakai itu. Rupa sama saya itu barang tidak pandai jalan.’ ‘Memang pandai jalan,’saya jawab. ‘Jika- lau pandai jalan apa sebab tidak jalan?’ tanya itu perempuan tua. ‘Sebab belum ada api,’ kata saya, tetapi perchaya saya atau perchaya saya tidak itu harap kurang. Dia tentu itu barang sudah rusak dan dia kuat mahu orang mata mata padam api, tetapi bagaimana dia pikir dia dapat ajar orang pakai barang rusak, atau apa guna buka barang yang chukup baik pereksa jikalau ada rusak, saya tentu saya tidak tahu. Tanya saya satu lain!
‘Panggil semua mata mata dan semua orang salah dan buat satu api besar dekat pangkallan peremah,’ kata itu chelaka nomber satu punya D.O. ‘Hell!’ saya bilang, dan saya chakap sedikit lagi di-bawah saya punya udara tetapi saya tidak lawan sebab itu Resident sana seblah D.O. sebab dia tidak suka makan mulong. Saya pikir itu D.O. tengok saya punya jantong bukan dalam itu sebab bila saya pergi suroh mata mata dan orang salah buat api dia sendiri pergi ambil tiga barang padam. Baik, dalam sedikit jam ada api besar dekat pang- kallan. Banyak mata mata dan orang salah ada sana dan semua orang China keluar daripada dia punya kedai lihat ini orang perentah yang sudah pergi giln. Dalam itu mata mata ada dua lance- corporal Melayu. Bukan sama sama kita gentle- men,” and here Mr. Poggy bowed graciously to the visitors. “sebab dia bodoh seperti semua orang Simanggang. Itu D.O. chakap, ‘Sekarang saya pakai satu barang padam api tunjok kita orang. Tetapi saya tidak padam itu api sebab saya mahu kita dua orang belajar padam sendiri. Tengok apa saya buat.’ Terus dia pukul dia punya barang di-
atas tanah dan terus ayer kuat keluar. Dia pusing dia punya barang ka-pada sungei dan itu ayer masok sungei. ‘Memang bagus,’ saya bilang. Dia ambil tidak notice sama saya tetapi chakap sama itu dua lance-corporal, ‘Tiru saya, tetapi jangan buang ayer dalam sungei; pakai kita punya ayer padam api.’
Terus itu dua lance-corporal pukul dia punya barang di-atas tanah dan terus ayer keluar tetapi itu jam ayer keluar ada binatang tupai lari melin- tang tanah. Itu lance-corporal terus tengok nya dan buru nya dengan dia punya ayer. Dia pakai barang padam api seperti senapang. Itu tnpai banyak laju; torus dia naik pokok dan terus itu ayer ikut sama nya. Tupai naik tinggi lagi totapi selalu ayer ikut. “Whoosh ! Whoosh ! Whoosh!” pergi itu ayer. ‘Oi! Oi! Oi!’ bilang semua orang China. ‘Wah ! Wah ! Wah!’ bilang semna orang mata mata. ‘Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!’ bilang semua orang salah (sebab itu macham orang bukan main educatod). Itu D.O. maseh berdiri di-atas pangkallan muka ka-sungei sebab dia punya ayer belum habis. Dia mahu maki sama itu lance- corporal dan dia stengah mahu buru itu tupai; belakang dia punya telinga memang jadi merah. Ujong-ujong api mati sendiri, ayer sudah habis, dan itu tupai maseh hidup dudok di-atas daun yang tinggi sekali chuchi dia punya tanggan. Sudah saya tertawa atau sudah saya tertawa! Benar saya tidak boleh perduli kurang.”
The sampan was slowing up as it reached Pang- kallan Batu and one of the paddlers prepared to clamber out. It was time for Mr. Poggy to bring his remarks to a close. “Hari-hari saya cherita ini macham kapada orang yang diam seberang,” he remarked affably. ‘‘Itu tolong lepas jam. Dulu saya selalu chakap Inggeris tetapi sekarang kita orang sudah sambong kami saya mahu chakap Melayu sebab saya pikir kita dua orang tidak chukup mengerti bahasa Inggeris.” The sampan was now fast. The Europeans disembarked. The two Malays followed, stepping diffidently but nimbly onto the steps of the Pangkallan. There they paused for a moment, swayed gently from side to side as if dazed by finding themselves suddenly on dry land, and then fell quietly backwards into the wator from whence they have never emerged again.

Q: What was Mr. Poggy's experience working at the sago plantations in Simanggang?
A: Mr. Poggy worked as an officer in charge of sago plantations in Simanggang, where he faced challenges such as lack of communication and understanding between different groups due to language barriers. He also encountered a situation involving testing fire extinguishers with the help of local residents, which led to amusement among those present.

  Red Riding Hood.
  "Get a move on,” says the wolf. "You've been
long enough coming through that wood. What
have you been doing—playing three-legged race
with a crab or something?"
  Red Riding Hood looks surprised. “Why,
what's worrying your chords?” she says. "Your
vocal organ is making noises like the double bass
in the circus hand during the lion act. Let me
examine your throat. Open the piano wide and
say 'Ah.' ”
  The wolf obliges, thus bringing Little Red Riding
flood within easy distance.
 - "Golly, that's a Cue new set you’ve got, granny,"
remarks Red, taking a survey of the wolf’s chew-
gallery.
  The most painstaking observation has convinced
an assiduous motorist in Detroit Saturday Night
that the significance of a driver’s hand protruding
straight out from the larboard window of his car
is as follows, possibilities being given in order of
their inherent likelihood :
  (at Driver is shaking ash front actual
cigarette,.
  (b)Is pointing out aeroplane, woodchuck
or humming bird to his wife.
  (c)nesting cramped arm from long
driving.
  (d)Stretching himself before proceeding.
  (e)Rubbing mosquito-bitten elbow on
window frame.
    (f)Shaking ash from imaginary cigarette.
  If the driver is of the female persuasion, our
observer says, this list must be completely revamped
and re-arranged.

Q: What did Red Riding Hood find unusual about the wolf's vocal organ in their conversation?
A: In their conversation, Red Riding Hood found it unusual that the wolf's vocal organ was making noises like a double bass in the circus during the lion act.

accustomed to different grades of headmen and
chiefs, and he is accustomed to the administration
of justice in bis native courts and in the magistrates’
courts. Tn any district which is sufficiently ad-
ministered to allow of a visit of the High Court he '
has no difficulty whatever in understanding that he
is accused of a serious crime and that a special kind
of officer, in a red robe, of special knowledge,
different from his administrative officers, is sent to
the district to try him. In the writer’s experience,
the native is by no means a stupid or terrified person
when his liberty or interests are concerned.
The Acting Governor of Kenya writes ;
I find myself in full agreement with the arguments
elaborated in paragraphs 2 to 9 of Mr. Wade's Memoran-
dum, and whatever criticisms may be passed on the
present system of administering justice in criminal
matters in Kenya, it is not, in my opinion, either logical
or fair to base such criticisms on its failure to conform
with a theory which in fact the Government had never
endorsed. . . . Any experienced Administrator could
quote oases both of convictions and of acquittals which,
though legally unassailable in the eyes of the trained
lawyer, have amounted in natives' eyes to a miscarriage
of substantial justice . . . financial considerations apart,
I should welcome the appointment of an additional Judge.
I have no personal knowledge of the magisterial work
of Administrative officers.
Mr. Wade writes :
Under such conditions as these it may well be that the
man best qualified to determine the facts in a native
criminal case is nol necessarily the expert in law, hut
one who, from having lived and worked among natives,
has some understanding of their customs and mentality
and is therefore ir. a better position to estimate tho value
of evidence than the Judicial Officer, whose contact with
the natives of the Colony is both remote and transitory.
It may be admitted that Administrative Officers are not
commonly so skilful in the conduct of judicial proceedings
hr are those who have made the practice of the law their
profession, but in Kenya any lack of skill there may be is
remedied to Rome extent at least by the system of
revision ' by the High Court.
Were it not for the expense involved T should welcome
the appointment of an additional Judge.
The Governor of Uganda, in his despatch, covers
the whole debate. It is not possible to deal at
length with his despatch, which must be read in
its entirety. It is clear that be has a poor opinion
of the value of judicial training. He writes :
In paragraph 65 of their Report the Commission have
recommended that a more extended use might ha made
oi the services of professional resident magistrates. They
state that they have it in evidence that much of the lime
of those magistrates is taken up in trying minor statutory
offences. They suggest that this is a waste of time of a
professional magistrate, but they make no suggestion as
to by whom such offences should be tried. . . . I
presume, therefore, that the Commission had it in the
back of their minds that such cases might be tried by
junior administrative officers. I venture to point out
that the junior administrative staff already perform at
toast as much routine office Work as is compatible with
the necessity for allowing them time to devote to the
study of languages, and for ensuring that they obtain as
much experience as possible under the tuition ol a senior
officer of the duties which they will ultimately be called
upon to perform themselves. I would therefore strongly
deprecate any addition to the duties which are laid upon
cadets and junior administrative officers. Further, with
due respect to the Commission, T feel that tho time of
the professional administrator is in valuable as that of a
professional magistrate, and T can see no justification
whatever for imposing upon the former duties winch the
Commission consider would lie u waste of lime in the
case of the latter. Those minor statutory offences nrn
precisely tho claw of eases in which local knowledge,
which is the special qualification of the administrative
officer, is ol the least value, and I am strongly oi Ilia
opinion that such minor statutory offences should in all
cases where possible bo tried by a permanent member of
tho judicial service.
This conception is new to the present writer. It
must, it is thought, be incorrect from a cash value,
since the salary of a stipendiary magistrate is twice
or even three times that of a junior administrative
officer: it may be that some spiritual value is
referred to. Later on in his despatch, the Governor
writes:
1 consider that more effective steps eon and should be
taken to ensure that junior administrative officers obtain
sufficient experience as magistrates.
This menus experience in the more difficult cages :
the simpler cases being allotted to the trained
judicial officer.

Q: What does Mr. Wade argue about determining facts in a native criminal case, and how do financial considerations affect this issue?
A: Mr. Wade argues that in determining the facts of a native criminal case, it may not necessarily be essential for an expert in law to handle such cases but rather someone who has lived and worked among natives, understanding their customs and mentality, as they would be better positioned to estimate the value of evidence than the Judicial Officer. Financial considerations affect this issue because appointing additional judges or allocating more resources towards judicial proceedings could involve significant expenses for the government.

J. C. SWAYNE.
Resident 2nd Class.
LAWAS.
—?—
February.
   Having received instructions to take charge of the Lawns and Trusan districts. I accompanied the Honble. the Divisional Resident here in the s. s. L’Aubaine on the 5th. atid took over from Datu Haji Halil the following day.
   After the Honble. the Resident's departure, I proceeded to Trusan via the overland route accompanied by Datu Haji Halil: we returned here via Sundar and Punang on the 21st.
   Mr. J P. Baird, of the Lawas Planting Company Limited, also accompanied me to Trusan to arrange about obtaining supplies of native rice and padi for the Company's employees.
   During the month I checked the chief clerk's accounts both here and at Trusan and found all correct ; the Customs accounts at Sundar were however not so well kept.
   In the Courts: Moktar bin Ali Hassan was sentenced to six months H. L. for intimidation and assault. Minah binti Haji was imprisoned for theft and sent to Limbang  to serve her sentence, and Yong Ah Lak, of the gambling farm, was fined for assaulting and injuring Prison Mander Mohamet Nur.
   Chinese New Year’s day on the 20th. was observed as a public holiday.
   On the 28th. I received instructions from the Honble. the Divisional Resident to check all existing stocks of opium, and notify the Chinese of the increase in price; and on the 30th. I received orders to double all export duties at once.
   Early in the mouth all the Government employees both here and at Trusan were informed that, now the local padi is being harvested, rice rationing will cease from the 1st. March.
   Native rice is obtainable here at 80 cents per gantang and padi 4 gantangs per dollar.
   Rewards have been offered to anyone reporting the smuggling of rice or padi to foreign countries.
   The m. t. Miri cleared for Miri on the 5th. with a cargo of sweet potatoes.
   The telephone line to the Lawas Planting Company's Estate, which had been out of order for some time was cleared and generally overhauled ; and the line to Trusan, which had become very overgrown, was also recleared.
   The prison gang of fourteen iiersons was chiefly employed clearing around the station.
   The rainfall amounted to 7'16 inches.
   The trade returns are as follows:—
        Foreign Imports.            Foreign Exports.
            $10,766	$25,073

Commenting upon the mining industry of the Bau District, the District Officer, (Mr. Richards) writes : “Very few mines are getting out gold and they plead the absence of machinery. The Onn Tung Mine received permission to mine antimony of which there appears to be plenty. Arsenic is plentiful but dangerous. It is possible that mines could shew a profit if they had the guidance of a qualified chemist and could think of something other than gold."
The following is an extract from the monthly report of the District Officer, Bau : “The water in Pegong Bekajang lowered a foot to about six feet below normal between 8th and 20th. In the absence of the screw parts for the valve, attention was paid to the intake at the lake and a grill and an iron plate were found by diving. The latter fitted the grooves and was eventually tied by wires to a lever beam with which to raise and lower the ‘door.’ Since the 21st the water has been shut off during the night with the result that the water level has remained almost constant.”
The following is extracted from the August Re- port of the District Officer, Serian, (Mr. Roberts) : "It is gratifying to record that several Dayak Kam- pongs are registering their own private schools. The Tua Kampong becomes the school manager, the village ‘komiti’ becomes the school management committee. All are enthusiastic about the Non- denominational schools, i.e. secular instruction only Monday to Friday, religious instruction permitted at the week end for those who wish to attend."
September, 1948.
The District Officer, Kuching, (Mr. Outram) writes that a double murder was reported to have been committed at Muara Tuang on the 12th September by a Chinese boy aged seventeen who shot his father and his uncle.
On the five day tour of the Samarahan and Bayor areas, the outboard dispensary attended to an averge of 435 cases. On its one day journey along the Simanggang Road, the jeep dispensary served an. average of 200 persons.
The District Officer, Kuching, following upon a visit to the Lundu area, comments that it may be possible to start a combined Malay, Land-Dayak, Sebuyau Authority shortly.
In the Kuching District, trade improved during September because of the stability of the price offered for rubber.
The District Officer. Bau, (Mr. Richards) reports a civil case in the courts which was brought on breach of contract of sale. Of five brothers having equal shares in a shophouse, three signed a memorandum of agreement to sell, saying the other two were willing. The other two then transferred the shop to another party for the same price with the concurrence of the former three. The original prospect ive buyer claimed his money back (three- fifths payment) with damages. The claim was allowed, but not in full for the damage.
The rainfall recorded at Dahan Estate was seventeen inches during September. The highest rainfall was recorded on the 18th when 3.25 inches fell.
Mention of the Bau water supply system has been made in earlier reports in the Sarawak Gazette. The District Officer reports that, on the 17th September, seven large holes re-opened but the fine displayed was not appreciated by water carriers who had been hard at work the previous day. Some pipes were cleaned and a few fish were caught.
The following is extracted from the monthly report of the District Officer. Serian. (Mr. Roberts) : "Several land disputes have been satisfactorily- settled by the Pemanchas. In one case the two kampongs concerned were under Kuching and Serian respectively ; however the Sarawak Pemancha Batek and the Sadong Pemancha Mapuk met on the spot and adjudicated jointly. It would be hard to speak too highly of the way in which the Pemanchas are carrying out their duties.”
The District Officer, Serian, stresses the acute need of Pagan teachers for kampong schools.
The following is extracted from the monthly report of the Native Officer-in-Charge. Ltindu, (Abang Haji Adenan) : “Pada 30 hari bulan sa-orang Melayu dari Kampong Setunggang benama Karia bin Busri ber-umor lebeh kurang 28 tahun sedang berpindah dari Kampong ka uma nya Batang Embang dengan perahu bermuat barang2 dan bini nya, kutika sampai nya ayer lagi kering, terpaksa menunggu si bentar. apa bila ayer besar ia pon menyuroh bini nya naik dan ia sandiri ma nurun kaki nya ka ayer kerana mem-betol kan perahu, kutika itu lah buaya lain ma-nangkap kaki nya. bini pon ber-teriak 'tangkap mata,' Karia terus menangkap mata tapi kena ka jungor, di tangkap nya sekali lagi bahru dapat, buaya itu pon melapas Karia. Karia terus naik ka darat dengan luka parah di kaki lalu di bawa orang ka rumah sakit, pada masa ini Karia akan di kirim dresser ka Kuching kerana her obat.”
The Honourable the Resident (Mr. White) com- ments that it cannot be easy to remain sufficiently cool and collected to do so (i.e. gouge out the eyes of a crocodile) even with one’s wife shouting advice from the bank.
SECOND DIVISION.
August, 1948.

Q: What is the current situation of mines in Bau District, August 1948, and what suggestions does Mr. Richards have for them to show a profit?
A: The current situation of mines in Bau District, as described by Mr. Richards, is that very few mines are successfully extracting gold due to the absence of machinery. He mentions that these mines plead their lack of productivity on this absence. However, he also notes that the Onn Tung Mine received permission to mine antimony and there appears to be plenty of it. Despite the presence of arsenic being plentiful in the area, Mr. Richards points out its danger but suggests that mines could potentially show a profit if they had the guidance of a qualified chemist and were able to think of something other than gold for extraction.

Sadong Collieries Report.
December, 1931.
Extracts from the Sadong Collieries Report for December, 1931, by Mr. J. W. Evans, Manager: -
The output, export, local consumption, and coal stock figures for the month are as follows: -
It is arranged that all the coal stocks stored at the mine entrances shall be washed, screened, and transported by railway to the wharf by the end of January, 1932.
The middle portion of the coal dump, situate between No. 8 and No. 9 mine, was carried away by an enormous landslide, which was caused by a heavy rainstorm on the night of the 18th, when 6.94 inches of rain fell in 2 1/2 hours. This avalanche of liquid soil, shale, and boulders completely destroyed the unoccupied storekeeper’s bungalow, and buried the Main Railway Line for a distance exceeding one hundred yards.
The Resident, First Division, visited the mines on the 20th.
The Chinese miners and labourers were paid off on the 30th, and removed to the Simunjan bazaar. The shopkeepers also vacated the mine bazaar on the following day.
Quantities of rails, ropes, and stores were shipped to Government Stores, Kuching, and the work of dismantling is proceeding apace.
The rainfall for the mouth was 30.14 inches.

Q: What caused the destruction of the unoccupied storekeeper's bungalow and burial of the Main Railway Line in December, 1931?
A: A heavy rainstorm on the night of the 18th, when 6.94 inches of rain fell in 2 1/2 hours, caused an enormous landslide that led to the destruction of the unoccupied storekeeper's bungalow and burial of the Main Railway Line for a distance exceeding one hundred yards.

On the 23rd I walked to Simatan, using the inland road in order to avoid as much of the walk along the sand as possible. I arrived at Simatan at 3 p.m. after a walk of six hours. At Simatan I checked the Stocks, etc., and the next day walked to Pengarah Kueh's village at Sebaku at the foot of Poi Mountain. I was able to compliment the Pengarah on the excellent state of his roads which were well cleared and properly bridged where necessary. All the Dyaks in this region are Slakau Dyaks and are obviously many grades above the usual Land Dyaks. Their houses are well built and cleanly kept, and they themselves were clean and decent looking. They appear to be energetic and progressive, many having prosperous and well kept pepper gardens.
On 25th we started up Poi Mountain, our objective being the peak known as Brumput. It came on to rain during the afternoon and we stopped at 3 p.m. under Batu Pensiong, where we stayed the night. Batu Pensiong is a splendid natural shelter formed by two huge granite rocks propped up against each other. It affords plenty of shelter for about twenty men. The next day we went up to the top, which is about 1 Â½ hours from the above-named shelter. A very fine view of Dutch Borneo is to be seen from the summit but the view of Sarawak territory is practically nil. The same day, after spending about two hours on the hill, we returned to Sebaku and the next day to Lundu by way of Serayan.
On 30th I returned to Kuching by m.l. Jean.
Agriculture.â€”The Dyaks of Stengang and Stungkor districts are just finishing the harvest which has been a great success. Some doors have got as much as 400â€”500 pasus, and hardly any less than 200.
The Slakau Dyaks have also had a good year, but the quality of the Lundu Dyaks and Malay's padi was disappointing.
Prisons.â€”The prisoners have averaged at 42.61 during the month, and have been occupied on the general upkeep of the station.
SADONG. The Officer-in-Charge, Mr. J. J. Hill, reports:â€” Court.â€”In the Lower Courts a number of cases were heard but none call for comment.
In the Resident's Court one case was heard under section 302 in which Tambi Kassim was sentenced to death, subject to confirmation from the Supreme Court.
Public Works.â€”The Government carpenter made several alterations to the store; fitting shelves, etc., and was later employed on repairing the Native Officer's quarters.
The contract for the new bridge over the Simunjan river was completed during the month, and the final payment was made on the 16th instant.
The new Kampong Saging-Colliery road is progressing slowly and it is hoped that it will be finished in some two months' time.
The Government pipe-fitter was employed during the later part of the month on the extension of the Kampong Saging water supply.
Travelling.â€”On the 7th I arrived back from the
Sebangan, accompanied by Native Officer Abang Hamdan.
It appears that the padi harvest in the Sebangan has been on the whole good, although soma houses appear to have been luckier than others.
The upper reaches of this river are completely overgrown with different species of grass in the main Rasau, Purun and Bakong. It is proposed in the near future to call out the Dyaks in this district to clear the stream.
A big trade in snake skin (ular plaie) is carried on in this district. 
Medical.â€”At the Government Hospital 10 patients were admitted, 9 were discharged and 2 died in the hospital, leaving 2 remaining at the end of the month.
At the Dispensary 134 out-patients made 197 attendances for treatment.
Agriculture.â€”Mr. Dare visited the station on the l0th and inspected Sahari's experimental garden, and also inspected the proposed padi area at Gunong Sedilo.
General.â€”The Acting Resident, Mr. J. C. Swayne, visited the station from the 8th to the 11th, and settled all outstation matters requiring his attention.
Mr. J. W. Evans, Manager, Sadong Colliery, left for Kuching by the L'Aubaine on the 21st.
The 24th, being Proclamation Day, the offices were closed.
Trade and Customs.â€” During the month twenty-five vessels entered and twenty-six cleared the port.
Sadong Collieries Report. June, 1930.
Report on Sadong Mines for June, 1930, by Mr. J. W. Evans, Manager. The output produced during the month was satisfactory, despite the damage caused to shallow working levels as the result of excessive roof pressure following heavy rains, which also flooded the dip workings of No. 12 Mine, where progress is temporarily held up, pending the dewatering of the area and the recovery of the submerged pump.
The old No. 9 haulage engine was removed and re-erected at the No. 12 Mine entrance.
There is still a serious shortage of skilled labour. Our efforts at local recruiting has been given a futher impetus by the continued trade slump, and we have, it present, a force of 66 Malays, 4 Dyaks, and 2 Indians respectively, employed on various jobs belowground.
The total rainfall for the month was 18.42 inches.

Q: What were some observations made during the trip to Simatan and Poi Mountain on 23 June 1930?
A: During the trip, several observations were made about the region and its inhabitants. The author noted that at Simatan, they checked stocks, etc., and found that all Dyaks in this region are Slakau Dyaks who appeared to be many grades above the usual Land Dyaks. Their houses were well built and cleanly kept, and the people themselves were clean and decent looking. They seemed energetic and progressive, with many having prosperous and well-kept pepper gardens.
When climbing Poi Mountain and reaching its peak known as Brumput, it was observed that there was a fine view of Dutch Borneo but the view of Sarawak territory was practically nil. After spending two hours on the hill, they returned to Sebaku and later to Lundu by way of Serayan.

there was no Court competent therefore to
entertain an appeal. In any case a sentence of ten
years’ imprisonment was not in accordance with
Sarawak law . but my decision rests on the ground
that there was no competent Court.
The conviction and sentence of death was confirmed
but a strong recommendation for mercy was
made to be forwarded to His Excellency the
Governor.
The Government of the United Kingdom is most
anxious that Sarawak should be a prosperous
country, inhabited by a united and contented people
capable of advancing towards self government in
common with the other dependencies of the Crown.
The foundations are being laid under your inspiring
leadership, and with the support of your able and
conscientious officers. I wish the whole great
enterprise the greatest and most lasting success.
In conclusion I should like to say how grateful
I am to yourself, your officers and the many people
whom I have seen and met, for their most friendly
and courteous reception, and their willingness at
all times to help me to make my visit a success.
Yours sincerely.

Obituary.
It is with deep regret that we announce the
death of Inche Haji Mohammed Zin, Datu Mentri,
on the 5th of February at his home in Kuching.
The Datu Mentri was bom in 1871 and entered the
Government Service in 1890 as a Malay School
Teacher. On the 24th June, 1907, he was
appointed Tua of Lower Kampong and Member of
the Supreme Council: on the 26th September.
1928, His Highness the Rajah appointed him to
be Datu Mentri.
In 1941, His Highness the Rajah wrote of the
Datu Mentri : “This Datu has been a loyal and
devoted officer of long standing service and I commend
him to the favourable consideration of the
Committee, knowing full well that there is no
Member of that Committee who will fail to
recognise his oustanding merit.
Ellin anak Masing v. The King.
The Supreme Court judgment in the case of Ellin
anak Masing v. The King, heard on the 22nd March
before the Hon. the Chief Justice (Dr. R. Y.
Hedges) is of considerable interest in relation to
Japanese decisions during the period of the
occupation.
The facts, briefly, are that the appellant was convicted
of murder in the Resident’s Court, Third
Division on 4th December, 1941. An appeal was
lodged but before the appeal could be heard the
Japanese Forces had occupied Kuching; the appeal
was brought to the attention of a Japanese police
officer, Takai, who sentenced the appellant to ten
years' imprisonment.
At this time, no civil Courts were functioning.
In his summing up. the Chief Justice said “It is
a fundamental principle of international law that
military occupation involves no transfer of
sovereignty, but a military occupant acquires
certain rights and becomes subject to certain duties.
The British interpretation of Article 23 (ft) of the
Hague Regulations is that it prohibits an occupant
of enemy territory from declaring extinguished,
suspended, or unenforceable in a court of law, the
rights and the rights of action of the inhabitants.
Article 43 provides that the occupant must respect,
unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the
country.
A military occupant may suspend the judges and
magistrates as well as other officials, but if he does
so he must temporarily appoint others in their
place. The decisions of Courts during the period of
Japanese occupation, given in accordance with
Sarawak law or with such regulations as the enemy
was lawfully entitled to prescribe, are prima facie
valid. On this subject 1 will quote that eminent
authority, Sir Arnold McNair, now a Judge of the
International Court of Justice :
“Thus we apprehend that if the enemy were
to occupy the Scilly Isles (we refrain from
mentioning the Channel Islands because they
have their own legal system) all the ordinary
transactions of private law taking place in
accordance with English law during the enemy
administration, such as constructs, dispositions of
movables and immovables, devolution of property
by will or upon intestacy, and all normal official
transactions such as the collection of ordinary
taxes, would, at the end of the occupation, be
treated as valid, and all judgments, civil and
criminal, given in accordance with the English
law or with such regulations as the enemy
was lawfully entitled to prescribe, would be
respected. ”
In the ease before me there were no civil Courts
functioning at the material date—January 1942-
and there was no Court competent therefore to
entertain an appeal.

Q: What was the reason for not having a competent court to entertain an appeal in Ellin Anak Masing v. The King case?
A: In the case of Ellin Anak Masing v. The King, there was no Court competent to entertain an appeal because at the material date (January 1942), there were no civil Courts functioning due to military occupation and the situation during the period of Japanese occupation.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, SEPTEMBER 1, 1927.
11.	A hopeless oxymoron. How could a single 
man look the whole world (i.e. either the actual 
earth or everybody inhabiting the earth) in the 
face? These uncivilized barbarians did not 
know that the earth was tetrahedronical, but 
imagined it to be a sphere. The text would 
therefore appear incorrect. Nor does the Pesh. 
give any help. It is probable that this is another 
piece of narrative interpolated by a latter editor 
of, perhaps, the 26th century.
12.	The Laurentian M S.S. has: "For he bowes not 
any han " On the contrary, B. Bernensis 363, 
which is followed by an ancient document 
bearing the names of Hobs and Sutliv has"For 
she hoes nat any land ' (Hoeing, whatever it 
was, appears to have been a common 
custom.) This is borne out by the reference in 
Liber Moldavicanus, recently unearthed in 
Stoshawhangbar by Lewis and Hobnob, to 
"Shoeing." By the omission of the first and 
fourth letters and a simple transposition of the 
words, we obtain the following, which makes 
good sense: - "She lands not any for-shoes." 
Now by merely omitting a letter here and 
there, this will be seen to refer to the Smith in 
line 2 This is borne out by Codex Boned, in 
the Eiffel Tower, Parix.
This knowledge will not, of course, be required by any 
student, but we think it is well to supply it.
The text ends abruptly here, probably owing to the fact 
that the scribe did not write any more This is, as a 
matter of fact, a pure conjecture, put forward by 
commentators of inferior talents, of whom the chief are 
Bentley, Hobnob and Theobald-(Contributed.)
Climate and Diet.
     FROM Ona MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT
We are undoubtedly more ruled by custom in the question 
of diet than in any other part of our daily life. Food fads 
and fancies appear from time to time in the daily Press, 
but on the whole we are probably right in believing that it 
is "The Roast Beef of Old England, that makes us what 
we are to-day." Other countries all over the world have 
their characteristic articles of diet such as the omelettes of 
France, macaroni of Italy, "Wiener Schnitzel" and 
caraway seeds of Austria, and the raw meat sausage of 
Germany. What it is that attracts attention abroad is the 
fact that diet sometimes varies according to the time of 
year. In the south of Europe one can eat in summer cold 
consomme, cold fish and cold coffee when the 
temperature is above 90 deg. in the shade; but not so in 
this country. The writer well remembers travelling down 
to Bath on a broiling July day and watching fellow 
travellers solemnly going through a menu which 
beginning with hot tomato soup (out of a packet) passed 
on to fried fish, roast beef and cabinet pudding! Heroes 
who will eat that menu in a heat wave are not going to 
flinch at the perils of India or Malaya, and one can but 
admire the audacity of the individual who consumes curry 
and rice in large quantities under such conditions.
The opposite tribulation may await the winter visitor to an 
English home, when owing to the rigours of Sunday a cold 
supper is served on the Sabbath though the thermometer 
may be below zero ; even a cup of hot soup is not allowed 
in some spartan households. While it is surmised that 
people in these islands suffer from excess of starch, as 
witness the innumerable cake shops, the jams and floury 
puddings which form such a large part of their daily diet, at 
the same time they probably consume too little fat either in 
the shape of butter, olive oil or cod liver oil. As for salads 
and fruit, it was until recently almost impossible to get 
these at any but a "crank" restaurant.
Children are certainly entitled to be fed as wisely and as 
simply as their parents' purses will allow, but the writer 
remembers trying to draw up a model diet sheet for 
children under the age of five in company with many 
distinguished dietitians: after several meetings no 
conclusions were definitely arrived at other than the 
statements quoted above. One would hesitate to be 
dogmatic, but merely to put in a plea for the broad 
principles that cold food is indicated in hot weather rather 
than hot meat and suet puddings: that ""appetite is the best 
sauce" and one that cannot be produced by chiding, prayers 
or threats: that one should feed as nature indicates, so that 
we should not force a child who dislikes eggs to take them, 
especially if on being forced it vomits or "comes put in 
spots." This automatic revolt of nature is described 
academically as "protein sensitisation," such as one gets in 
the bay fever patient or in the folk who similarly respond to 
eating shell-fish or strawberries.
   Much has been done in the past to impress upon young 
minds the need and the desirability of consuming large 
quantities of milk puddings. The dish, though tasteful to 
some, arouses in others feelings of nausea and depression.

Q: What is the opinion on the dietary habits of different countries mentioned in the texts dated 1 September 1927?
A: The text highlights that each country has its characteristic articles of diet, such as omelettes from France, macaroni from Italy, "Wiener Schnitzel" and caraway seeds from Austria, and raw meat sausage from Germany. It also mentions how the type of food consumed can vary according to the time of year in different countries. For example, people in southern Europe may eat cold consomme, cold fish, and cold coffee during hot summer months, while in England, a hot menu is typically served even during high temperatures. The text implies that each country's dietary habits are unique and adapted to their local preferences and climates.

Mazed, I stood there watching this internal-combustion-velocipedical-equine procession, and thought to myself of the Kuching of not so many years ago—say somewhere round the year 1912.
I remember but two cars in the town-and then they did not always go.
There was a motor bike and sidecar-a most dashing affair, and one solo. The first motor bus appeared in 1912 and used to run to the 7th mile—at least it was so advertised to run. Actually it was about even money on it reaching the 2nd mile, 3-1 against to the 5th mile and 10-1 the 7th mile. I remember one day joining a picnic out to Quop. We boarded the vehicle which ran all right until the first hill was reached. There it stopped half way up and started to run backwards. We all jumped out and clung on to the vehicle. This occurred at every subsequent hill, the driver admitting that he never could remember which was the clutch and which was the brake. We used the bus once again to go to the races-but having unfortunately gone through one of the pet P.W.D. culverts, it mysteriously disappeared for ever.
Those were the days of horse-flesh, when people kept ponies for use—and not merely for pot-hunting. Any morning you could meet half a dozen owners out on the Green Road, and a favourite gallop was down the Datus Road, now, alas, covered with stone.
There was no railway, a cinema only at intervals, and perhaps a couple of hundred push bikes. The Inspector of roads used a bullock cart to take him to the end, and slept the night there. Young Chinese ladies had not yet taken to bicycling (in fact, their costumes forbade such a pastime) nor did they do pillion riding. Saises had never heard of Tom Mix and Baby Austins were still unborn.
What a change! In those days there was an air of dignified repose about the streets and roads surrounding the bazaar. One heard but the patter-patter of the ricksha men or the tinkle of a bullock cart. The raucous horn-the bang and clatter of the motor lorries-the groans of the taxis-the rumble of the busses-the piercing shriek of the train-the abominable din of the motor tractor. There were yet to come.
People lived a less hurried life. A newly-joined Cadet’s calling list meant a formidable campaign of rickshaw riding for several afternoons-nowadays $4.50 for an hour and a half of a battered Chevrolet suffices. A trip to Bau or Matang was a lengthy business-now it is merely a one day picnic. Europeans took a pride in their private rickshaws, and even the public ones were frequently raced by rostering outstationers.
There is no end to this grousing. Why, even the whisky tastes different (and is too, as a matter of fact) and the liquid which admits on its own label to have merely “the properties of real gin” has not the real knock-em-over effect of square face. Anyway the little Chinese pillion rider looked very nice-and that’s something anyhow!
The Autumn Race Meeting.
In another column will be found the programme for the coming meeting.
There will be the usual $2 and $1 Totalisators. Cash Sweeps on each race and an Unlimited Sweep on the last race of the second day. The bar will be run by the Sarawak Club and there will be a tea-room.
Training has started in earnest, but many well-known ponies are apparently being kept dark.
01' Man River has come on amazingly, and with his long stride should win. Palawan is a particularly attractive with a bit of blood in him. Kim Mah is going better than usual and Happy Boy will probably win again. The old veteran Kismet has not gone off. and Sisit is galloping well. Popacatepetl (who has changed hands) is as sluggish as ever, and Apa Kena will not try. Pengarah should pick up a race in Division II. Mudahan and Almas do not impress us at present and old Burak seems to have seen his best days.
One side of the Paddock buildings is being roofed entirely with billian sttaps
It is noticed that many gentlemen now residing in Kuching are not yet members of the Turf Club.
Members are reminded that they cannot introduce permanent residents in Kuching as visiting members. Non-members are charge $5 per day admission to the enclosure.
The Honorary Secretary asks us to inform our readers that he will be only too happy to propose intending members and find them seconders. Entrance fee is $10 with $10 annual subscription for Kuching members and $5 for outstation members.

A somewhat absurd illustration of the difficulties that await incautious jungle travelers occurred lately at one of the gambier gardens. A Chinese coolie was missed, and a vigorous search was made for him in the vicinity, but without success. On the fifth day the man was accidentally come upon within a few hundred yards of the house, and it appears doubtful whether during the whole time he had been mueh farther.

Q: What were some differences between transportation methods in Kuching around 1912 compared to today?
A: In 1912, Kuching primarily relied on horse-drawn carriages, ponies, and bicycles for transportation. There were only a few cars present in the town, and motor buses had just started to appear. Horse-riding was common among locals for both leisure and daily commute purposes. In contrast, today's Kuching has a more modernized transport system with an array of options such as private vehicles, taxis, motorbikes, public buses, and even trains. Additionally, the introduction of air travel has made it easier to reach Kuching from other parts of Sarawak or Malaysia. The noise pollution caused by various modes of transportation in modern times was non-existent during that period.

arrived on the 15th and the following day a meeting
of Tuais was held in the Fort when amongst other
things the question of Dyaks working jungle produce
in Netherlands Borneo was again brought up, there
being great feeling amongst the Balled Dyaks
against the prohibition of the Dutch Government of
their working in Dutch Territory. The Dyaks
maintain that it was clearly defined at the Peace-
making in 1924 that they should be allowed to work.
It appears to me that it is not the fact that they are
not allowed to work over there that annoys them so
much as that Dutch subjects come over this side
and work here without hindrance, whilst a Dyak is
arrested if he attempts to work the other side. The
Resident promised to lay the matter in front of
His Highness the Rajah as soon as possible.
   There was also a complaint from a Dyak named
Gruna that he was arrested by Dutch Kenyahs in
S. Tassuk (Sarawak Territory) and had a lot of his
property stolen before being handed over to Dutch
Officials who put him in jail. A letter was sent to
the Controlleur, Long Nawang. re this.
   On the 20th. accompanied by the Penghulu
Temmongong and Penghulu Ansi, I left to visit all
the houses in the latter’s district, some 20 longhouses
of Dyaks remaining in the Batang Rejang above
Kapit. Ansi, who has for many years been of great
assistance to Government, has just been made a
Penghuln. I walked from the S. Aya to the 8. Sum
and again from the Pelages to Ansi’s house above
the rapids, the latter journey only taking four hours
and saving two days’ boat trip. Many farmers had
not yet burnt off their clearings and the continued
wet weather will make them later still. I returned
to Kapit at the end of the month.
   P.W.D.— The new clerk’s house was completed
and a start has now been made on extension to the
fortmen’s quarters Prisoners averaged 19 men
were employed on the general upkeep of the
station.
   Trade and Shipping. The s.s. Sarawak made
four trips, s.l. Chamois two trips and the Soon Aik
and Bintang one trip each. 146 piculs of plantation
rubber, 193 piculs damar dagiug, 1.057 piculs rattan
tot No. 2. and 7 piculs gutta-percha were shipped
away during the month.
   Court.—The only case calling for mention is one
of a Dyak named Bankong who was fined for
brawling and wounding his father with a parang
whilst under the influence of drink. Fines and
fees amounted to $356.

Q: What were the main concerns discussed during the meeting of Tuais, particularly regarding Dyaks working in Netherlands Borneo?
A: The main concern discussed during the meeting of Tuais was the issue of Dyaks working jungle produce in Netherlands Borono. There was great resentment among the Balled Dyaks against the prohibition by the Dutch Government on their work within Dutch Territory, as they believed it violated a clear definition made at the Peace-making in 1924 that allowed them to continue working. The issue seemed more about the unfairness of this restriction while Dutch subjects were free to work on either side without hindrance.

42	THE SABAWAK GAZETTE, FEBRUARY 1, 1926.
  Native Affairs — The various Tua Tua Kampong,
both Mohammedan and Pagan Melanau. were re-
minded to report all cases heard in the Kampong
Courts at the Port, and to pay in or notify all fines
imposed by them in order that a proper record may
be kept of all such hearings. These Chiefs were
also recommended to continue to hear and settle
their own cases rather than take even the most
trivial disputes to the Mohammedan Native Court
for decision.
  Trade and Shipping.—The. Trade Returns for the
months are as follows :—
                       Coasting Imports.            Coasting Exports.

   General.-Mr. R. V. Palfreman was appointed to
do duty in this District and arrived by m.s. Muara-
tebas on the 14th. He left for Tatau on the 17th
where he has been appointed Acting Assistant
District Officer with powers of a District Court
Magistrate. Mr. E. Banks returned from Kidurong,
where he had been collecting specimens for the
Museum, on the 8th, and left again for the ulu Sebiau
on the 12th.
   The 11th being Armistice Day was a general holiday.
Two minutes' silence from 11 o’clock was observed.
   News of the death of Queen Alexandra was received
here on the 22nd and the flag was half-masted
   Mr. N. A. Middlemas. Superintendent of Surveys,
arrived by s.s. Gladys from Min on the 1st and left
again on the 3rd for Kuching.
    Mr. P. Down Accountant in Telegraphs and Tele-
phones Department, also returned to Kuching by that
vessel.
   The S.R. Gladys also called here northbound on the 29th. Amongst the passengers was Mr. Woodward bound for Baram.
   Trade.—Trade is being greatly handicapped by the smallpox, and little or no produce is being worked in this river. Large consignments of jelutong  have, however, been coming in from Suai, and the price of this commodity has reached $19 per picul.
The Trade Returns for the mouth are as follows:— 1925.	1924.
     Imports	...	$65,518.86	$36,219.21
     Exports	78,497.40	34,158.08
   The following vessels entered and cleared the putt during the month: —
Entered schooners 4 cleared schooners 2
        ,, steamers 5	„ steamers 6
   The rainfall was 16’47 inches.
  The District Officer of Bintulu reports as follows: — Court.—On account of smallpox there has been very little litigation during the month. Tua Kampong Salleh was fined $100 lor concealing a case of smallpox in his own bouse. Tua Kampongs Awang Mail and Dali were each fined $50 for being absent from their kampongs without leave find each man in those two kampongs was fined $2 for continually hiding cases and refusing to report known cases of ’ smallpox in their kampongs. Kamarudin, $25 for refusing to take his infected children to the Isolation . Camp.
  Health.— The Dresser in Charge went to Pandan on the 1st and found thirteen cases of smallpox there. Both the Tua Kampongs had run away. Having  isolated these cases he returned to Bintulu on the 3rd. On the following day four more cases appeared here in Kampong Dali, and Joon Choy, the Forest Clerk, also developed the disease.
  On the 6th news arrived from Pandan that the I sick were being deserted by their relatives and that there was no one to bury the dead. The Dresser  was again sent to Pandan and as he could be ill spared from here, I wired Kuching for help. On the 9th three more cases appeared here. On the 11th Joon Choy was seriously ill and I sent to Pandan and I fetched the Dresser back hem I regret Joon Choy j died on the 12th. August Chai, Dresser from Kuching, arrived here by m.s Muaratebas on the 14th and the local Dresser then returned to Pandan.
  Lately only one more case has appeared here and be w as a prisoner, but I’m afraid them are still many cases in the jungle in huts. Many deaths have already been reported from these huts, where the people have taken their sick rather than that they should go into the Isolation Camp. There have been over tinny deaths here reported to date. There are no doubt many more to be reported from the jungle, and at Pandan there have been sixteen deaths.

November, 1925.

Q: What were the recommendations made to the Chiefs of the Tua Tua Kampong in regards to their role in hearing cases?
A: The recommendations made to the Chiefs of the Tua Tua Kampong were for them to continue hearing and settling their own cases rather than taking even trivial disputes to the Mohammedan Native Court for decision, and to report all cases heard in the Kampong Courts at the Port, as well as pay or notify any fines imposed by them. This was suggested so that a proper record may be kept of all such hearings.

The School started again on the 1st with a total of 38 boys attending: the Masters at present consist of a junior one for the Chinese class and a Malay to teach that language and preliminary classes in English and Arithmetic.
   It has been difficult to find labour at a reasonable figure to clear the roads which I wished to have done by contract for the year or on monthly wages. I was unable to get any Chinese at 50 cents a day and the amounts asked for a monthly contract were absurd; it is quite evident to me that coolies at any rate are not suffering from the fall in pepper or there would be more looking for work at. a reasonable figure.

   Ulu Ai affairs.—Whilst I was at Betong on the 25th Penguin Dimpi reported that a small party of his people, from Tuga, who were out after bees’ nesta in the Ulu Entabai were attacked on the 21st whilst asleep at night in their hut.
   Their surprise was complete and two were killed and three got away wounded. The enemy numbered sixteen and made off in the direction of Lanjer Hill. The pursuit, owing to the distance, was ineffectual.
   P. Nyamba of L. Antu died of hemorrhage on the 27th. I have directed his cousin Baja to hold the Penguluship for the present.
   I learnt on March 3rd (when at Kabong) that the three Chinese Secret Society prisoners—Tau Ah Long, Chua Ah Khoon and Chong Ah Lee

Q: What were the challenges faced by E. R. Stilwell in finding labor for clearing roads?
A: E. R. Stilwell found it difficult to find labor at a reasonable figure to clear the roads, as he was unable to get any Chinese workers at 50 cents a day and the amounts asked for a monthly contract were considered absurd by him.

I think
that the way to treat this case is to make express
findings on all questions of fact; to look at the
entire picture as a whole; and then to put to my
self the question whether the prosecution have
satisfied me that neither the customs of the Chinese
community in general, nor the customs of the Hokkien
and Teochew communities in particular, would
recognise the panorama thus revealed as constituting
a quasi-marital relation between the
accused and Lim Ong Ah. I understood by the
expression “quasi-marital relation” a union between
a man and a woman which does not amount in law
to a marriage but which confers substantially the
same rights and imposes substantially the same
obligations on each party vis-à-vis the other as
would be conferred or imposed by a valid legal
marriage except in so far as custom permits a man
to have more wives, or a woman to have more
husbands, than might be permitted by law. I must
first consider this transaction as composed of all its
ingredients and then treat the question of recognition
or non-recognition by custom as a question of
fact to be answered “yea” or “no”. A girl aged
14, that is below the legal age of marriage by
Chinese custom, was transferred by her mother from
the house in which her parents lived together to
the house of the accused for the purpose of enabling
the latter to have sexual intercourse with her at an
early date. It was never intended by any party
that such intercourse should await the girl's attaining
the age of 15. The transfer of her person took
place without the knowledge or approval of her
father and without the active consent of herself.
The accused and the girl possessed the same surname.
The mother in exchange for her daughter
received $334 on different dates, the various sums
being called by names culled from Chinese Marriage
custom. The mother also received two rings. The
negotiations opened with a meeting in a coffee-shop
in conformity with the Chinese marriage ceremony
of "sio-bin". The accused had three accomplices—
the girl’s mother, who made a neat little profit of
over $200 and two rings; the go-between who has
never been able to make up her mind as to whether
she was acting as a real go-between or not but who
incidentally obtained repayment of a debt of $100
as her share of the spoils : and the woman who
regards herself as accused’s principal wife. The
circumstances of the removal of the girl to tbe
accused’s house were furtive. A dark deed is best
done darkly, and evening had shaded into night
when the bridal party set out on its journey.
Although the motor-car was at the gruel stall near
the house where the girl and her mother lived, after
the go-between had got tired of waiting at the place
of assignation along Rock Road, it was hastily sent
back whence it had come, probably in case the
father should notice and object to the abduction of
his daughter. Tbe girl and her mother proceeded
on foot to Rock Road where they entered the car.
When the car, after a short tour of the bazaar,
reached the accused’s house he was not at home, a
fact which Mr. Chan Kwee Chong considers is
unheard of at a proper marriage of a secondary wife
and for which the accused has offered an explanation
which is entirely inadequate. The girl performed
no ceremonies in accused's bouse of the nature
which a primary wife usually exacts from a
secondary wife on the occasion of the latter's wedding.
It is interesting to note that the woman
explains that these ceremonies would have been
performed when a feast, apparently unknown to
Chinese custom, was held on the following Monday
on which day the marriage would be registered,
while the accused gave the day intended for this
novel feast as the day after the girl’s arrival, that
is the Friday, and said, without making any
reference to the projected registration, that after
this final nuptial ceremony, selected by him but
unwarranted by custom, be intended to have that
intercourse with his bride which his moral sense
precluded him from enjoying before the feast.
Those are the facts of the matter; that is the whole
picture; and I must now ask myself whether the
prosecution has convinced me that the accused and
Lim Ong Ah were not thereby united by any union
or tie recognised by their personal custom as constituting
a quasi-marital relation. I decide that I am
so convinced. I am satisfied that the accused
intended to have illicit intercourse and that his
assertions of a secondary marriage are mere histrionics.
Having reached that conclusion I think
I may go further and say that, in my view, it
would be tantamount to a defamatory libel on the
Chinese people of Sarawak to hold otherwise. I
convict the accused of the offence of buying a minor
girl under 18 years of age with intent to use her
for the purpose of illicit intercourse under section
373 of the Penal Code.
I can deal with the fourth charge very quickly.

Q: What is the definition of "quasi-marital relation"?
A: A "quasi-marital relation" refers to a union between a man and a woman that does not amount to a legal marriage but confers substantially the same rights and imposes substantially the same obligations on each party vis-à-vis the other as would be conferred or imposed by a valid legal marriage, except in cases where custom permits more than one spouse.

It was a Bisaya who in November 1858 killed James Brooke’s greatest enemy, Pengiran Makhota, during one of his concubine-collecting tours. And the Bisayas it was who hoisted the Sarawak flag and secured for Rajah Sir Charles Brooke the annexation of Limbang in 1890. Increased immigration to Limbang from Brunei followed this blessing, but the Bisayas of Sarawak mainly remain nevertheless a small and isolated group having little to do with others. Some inter-marriage with Malays, Murut and Iban has occurred, but the Limbang Bisaya continues, by and large, shy, conservative and pagan. Since his revolt against Brunei and secession to Sarawak he has influenced the affairs of state apparently not at all.
The Bisaya has been thought by some to be ethnically related variously to Kadayans, Muruts and others. Limbang Bisayas deny this, but acknowledge similarities of speech and culture with some North Borneo Dusuns and with the Melanau, though their contacts with both are negligible.
The Bisaya is of fair complexion. The features of the men have been called effeminate but I think this was more the result of the hair-style affected by Bisaya men (but now rarely seen) of coiling the uncut long hair loosely around the crown of the head. This did indeed give to the smoother featured gentleman a rather prissy school-marm look. But the Brooke haircut (as it was called in my day) made a man look more what he was, I think. Certainly the masculinity of the offences of which Bisaya men seemed too often to be convicted, belied any theory of effeminacy. The men also have very unlady-like feet. Nature has adapted the Bisaya body to his swampy environment.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, DECEMBER 31, 1958
Short-legged and squatly-built like a buffalo, his feet are made to reduce his pounds-per-square-inch ground pressure. He can, better than any I know, walk on the water—as is literally necessary when crossing their overgrown lakes.
Bisaya women on the contrary are often delicately made. Fair and sometimes seemingly fragile. That they are fair, and often comely, is no doubt why they were at a premium in Brunei harems. But their frailty is, like the man’s effeminacy, often deceptive.
Neither men nor women are tattooed with any traditional designs, but burn-scar patterns were sometimes applied to the forearms of young men. The men never pierce the ears. Older women wear ear plugs of distinctive shape. These are truncated cones with the forward projection flared out and rounded; on this dome end, if not over the whole, there is gold and enamel ornamentation. But the young generation prefers modern ear rings and pendants, and favourite girl children are fitted with them at an early age as also with silver or other bracelets and anklets of Brunei or Chinese make. Young men. who once filed their upper incisor teeth like the Iban, and more recently fitted brass false teeth over the stumps, have now quite abandoned the practice.
The Bisaya language contains some Malay words, but it is not a Malay dialect. Apart from its relationship to certain North Borneo and Brunei Dusun tongues, associations in Sarawak, if any, are not known. The Limbang speech has peculiarities almost from kampong to kampong but is principally distinguished by its very gutteral character; being produced deep in the throat. It has no native literature or reliable published vocabulary.
In habit Bisayas are static; they do not move house, travel far, or migrate. This is because they are property owners. Their immovable assets are sago and rubber gardens and fruit groves. Their movable wealth is in buffaloes (and maybe some other livestock), ancient brassware and jars, gold and silver ornaments. They do not value beads.
They grow padi by very crude methods, but most Bisayas eat sago as a staple for part of the year. Their sago is prepared in the simplest possible fashion by stirring boiling water onto the crude wet sago flour, so producing a very stiff launderer’s starch. It is dirty brown in colour and eaten by stirring one's chopsticks quickly in a small circle, putting the adhering gobbet of goo in the mouth and withdrawing the chopsticks between tightly closed lips. The gag of gum is swallowed without salivation, and when in an hour or so all water is distilled from a heavy bellyfull of sago the result is very little except early hunger and subnutrition. But like Muruts and Kelabits, Bisayas like their starch starchy. They can and do cook rice as rice should be cooked, but to make it go further—and always for breakfast or a carried lunch—the Bisaya cooks the rice with too much water, beats it into a stiff paste and wraps measured portions in leaf. This, cold, with something sweet or sour, bland or bitter, salt or insipid—or even alone—is your breakfast or wrapped lunch, again eaten with chopsticks and swallowed without mastication.

Q: What is the relationship between the Bisaya language and other languages in North Borneo and Brunei?
A: The text states that "the Limbang speech has peculiarities almost from kampong to kampong but is principally distinguished by its very gutteral character; being produced deep in the throat. It has no native literature or reliable published vocabulary." Furthermore, it mentions that "the Bisaya language contains some Malay words, but it is not a Malay dialect. Apart from its relationship to certain North Borneo and Brunei Dusun tongues, associations in Sarawak, if any, are not known." This suggests that the Bisaya language has similarities with languages spoken by North Borneo Dusuns and the Melanau but their connections are minimal due to limited contacts.

   At Trusan,Rigu Ginat (f.) petitioned for a 
divorce from her husband Lim Thain Seng.The 
evidence was taken down and will be forwarded to 
the proper quarter.
   Travelling.-I returned from Limbang on 3rd. 
Mr.G.M.Allman,Superintendent of Rubber 
Exports,arrived on 14th.On 18th I left for 
Trusan with Mr.Allman and Mr.Cook,calling at 
Sundar on the way.We returned on the afternoon 
of 21st,spending the night at Kuala Kaku and 
reaching Lawas next day.
   On 23rd the Resident visited Lawas leaving again 
on 27th.During his stay he inspected all Public 
Works.He also visited the estate and went to 
Erasan to see Mr.Cook's clearing.
   Prisoners.-The average number of prisoners 
during the month was 3.8.They were employed 
on the general upkeep of the station and in repair- 
ing the kampong road.
   Public Works.-Work on the Sualai and Gaya 
roads progressed satisfactorily during the month. 
If more coolies could be obtained the rate of 
progress would be considerably increased.The 
kampong road was widened by prison labour,but 
it is not yet certain whether it will be possible to 
metal this road.
   The wire clips for the Siang Siang bridge proved

Northward on his return from furlough in order to spend a few days in Kuching, where he was the guest of Mr. W. Harnack. We deeply regret to record the death, which occurred at the General Hospital, Singapore, on January 15th. of Dr. G. E. Brooke. Dr. Brooke, who was for many years Chief Health Officer Singapore, came to Sarawak to reorganize the Health Department in 1928 and retired in 1931. During his stay in Kuching he was responsible for the lay-out of the public gardens in the Museum grounds, a task in which he was eminently successful; the gardens are now one of the chief amenities of the town, and will remain a fitting memorial to him. Mr. J. B. Archer, Resident, Fourth Division, paid a visit to Kuching during January, arriving on January 18th and leaving on the A very successful Regatta was held at Kuching on New Year’s Day under the auspices of the Secretary for Native Affairs, the Datus and some of the leading Malays and Chinese. The full programme and results will be found under First Division News. Mr. and Mrs. A. L. McLaine returned from Singapore by s.s. Darvel on January 6th, and left for Sibu the same afternoon. Mr. and Mrs. L. D. Kennedy returned by the Vyner Brooke on January 20th. Kudang. a Dayak outlaw and murderer, was killed by levies on January 8th. His head was brought to Song Fort, and the Government reward of $500 has been paid to those responsible. Two other "wanted” Dayaks. Makau and Serai, were captured a few days later by police detachments under Mr. A. Macpherson and Native Officer Wan Bujang. Both men are believed to have been concerned in the Pelagus affair which took place in August. 1934. and in which a Malay and a Kayan were killed by a Dayak raiding party. Makau and Serai are at present awaiting trial Mr. K. H. Digby. Passed Cadet, has been transferred to Bau. where he is attached to the District Office for special duty in connection with mining. Mr. Digby recently completed a census of the Simanggang Road area. The results of this census were rather remarkable, since it was found that nearly 3,000 people are living in the one-mile reserves between the 10th mile and Serian. and that, in this same reserve there arc some , 7,300 acres of land not merely alienated, but actually under cultivation. It should be borne in mind, also, that the reserve is by no means the whole area served by the road. These figures are significant when it is realized that the road, which has always been far from perfect, has only been open during the worst years of the depression, and that ever since it has been open immigration has been rigorously restricted. Visitors to Kuching during January included Messrs. G. A. Farrelly and R. E. Le Sueur from Sibu, and Mr. G. Kidd. Manager of Tanah Estates. Ltd., from Kanowit. Mr. C. D. Le Gres Clark returned from : furlough by the Vyner Brooke on January 20th. Mr. Le Gros Clark has been appointed Secretary for Internal Affairs, and has been promoted to Class IB of the Civil Service. Mr. J. R. Outram, Passed Cadet, has been transferred from Bau to Limbang. Dr. Brooke. So Dr. Gilbert Brooke has pissed on—a true Malayan, if ever there was one, a lover of this country in its many aspects and one of the few Europeans who have sunk roots deep enough to enable them to retire here. In Dr. Brooke’s case, there was also the presence of various members of his family to keep him in Malaya, but that was by no means the whole story. He had too many local interests to enable him to settle down happily anywhere else. I have never known anyone who was so calm, so gentle one might almost say, and yet so efficient. His office in Singapore, when he was reorganising quarantine, work in the port and extending antimalarial protection on the island and doing half a dozen other things besides, always seemed to be running like a well-oiled machine. Dr. Brooke and Dr. Scharff made an admirable team in those days. Even one who, like myself, had met Dr. Brooke only casually and occasionally must feel sorrow at his passing. One always felt that in him there was a living example of how to live in Malaya, how to put back into the. country something in return for what one got out of it. And he had the rare and enviable gift of getting the best out of an Asiatic staff by inspiral ion rather than coercion.—“ANAK SINGAPURA' in the Straits Times. Racecourse Development Fund.

By the passing of John Hardie at the age of 78
the British Community in Labuan hits lost its oldest
landmark. Mr. Hardie was taken seriously ill at
the beginning of August, but by reason of a remark-
ably strong constitution he lingered mi for two and
a half months and passed away peacefully in his
sleep on October 9th. He was buried in the
Christian Cemetery in Labuan on October 10th
when a large body of friends representative of all
classes and races attended the service.
   The first part of the service was held m the church
of Holy Saviour of which church Mr. Hardie had 
been church warden for many years : The Bishop of
Labuan and Sarawak officiated, and Mr. J. A. H.
Hardie of the Sarawak Civil Service, son of the ,
deceased, was chief mourner. The pall bearers were 
Mr. Edmund Roberts, Officer in charge, Labuan, 
Dr. T. C. A. Cleverton : Messrs. It. M. MacAlpine,
W. S. Bevan and R. J. Marshall of the E. E. 
Telegraph Co. and Mr. J. S. Montgomery of
Vanscolina and Co. Many beautiful wreaths wit-
nessed the respect and affection in which Mr. Hardie
was held by all classes.
   Mr. John Hardie had a remarkable career. The
son of Mr. John Hardie of B. O Mains, he was born
at Bo'ness Linlithgowshire. Scotland in 1841 and
was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh.
In 1863 he sailed for Singapore and joined the
Borneo Company Ltd., being sent to their newly
formed branch in Sarawak, where lie worked under
Mr. Helms, their first Manager in Kuching. He
was soon transferred to Mukah, Sarawak, to take
charge of the Company’s sago factory and there
remained for ten years, when he returned to the
capital as Manager of the B. C. L. In 1886 he
retired and returned to Scotland.
   Next year, however, on account of failing eyesight,
he left the old country and sailed in a sailing ship
via the Cape to Australia where he bought a farm 
in Barraloong and managed it. At this period, in
1891, he married Mary Christina daughter of Dr.
Fisher of Melbourne, but about the same time he, like
many others, was severely crippled financially by
the failure of the Australian Bank and had to begin
all over again. Possessed of indomitable energy
and determination be set sail with his wife for the
F. M. 8. and became manager of the Punjom Gold
Mines near Kuala Lipis, just about the time when
the state was disturbed by the notorious Malay rising.
Mr. Hardie had immediately to send his wife down
the Pahang river to Singapore for safety, and during
this voyage she was several times sniped at by the
disaffected Malays, but eventually got safely through
to Singapore where she gave birth to her only son
in 1892. Mr. Hardie then enrolled himself under
Sir Hugh Clifford and assisted in suppressing the
Pahang Rebellion.
   In 1894 Mr. Hardie made his first acquaintance
with Labuan, when he become manager of the
Borneo Minerals Company, and prospected along
with Mr. H. H. Everett in Baram and Brunei In
1898 he started his own business in Labuan as a
merchant and also held the post of Sarawak Government Agent from 1808 to 1912, after which date
he confined himself solely to his own work until the
time of his death.
   Mr. Hardie took a prominent part in the social life
of the Settlement and was especially’ interested in
horsemanship and racing. He was also the President 
of the Labuan Golf Club and a J. P. for many
years. In his later years he was a keen croquet
player and taught many friends how to play that
game scientifically. He was always a good friend,
a perfect best and an interesting conversationalist.
      He was ever ready to lend a helping hand to those
in distress, a God fearing man, deeply interested in
church welfare and if one phrase could lie found to
sum up all his qualities, he might justly be described
us ” God's good man. ’’ His remains are laid beside
those of his wife and his brother, who predeceased
him, and he is survived by his only son.
   May he fest in peace and may light perpetual
shine upon him.—( F. P. )

Q: Who was the oldest landmark of the British Community in Labuan?
A: The oldest landmark of the British Community in Labuan was John Hardie.

November, 1919.
   A good many disputes connected with jelutong working both here and at Tatau have been settled during the month. There has also been a readjustment of permits, none being granted except to those who actually work jelutong and then only for as much as each headman and his party can comfortably deal with. Permits used to reserve jelutong only, as explained in my October report, have been called in and cancelled.
   Several complaints have been made lately, mostly by Punans, about the disposal of valuables deposited by them as security with traders from whom they want credit. Very often the trader demands a pledge before giving credit. If payment is long delayed the pledge is sold by the creditor, who pays himself partly or entirely out of the proceeds. It is impossible to stop this altogether, but cases can be dealt with separately as they arise. Punans here can he proceeded against for debt and the Chinese allow them to run up surprisingly large accounts, whereas it would appear that few Punans have any intention of paying if they can help it. Hence if a trader will not trouble to make his man sign a contract to work jungle produce he gets a pledge instead. Other up-river tribes who cannot be sued in the Court of Requests give very little trouble either to tinders Or the Government although they work jungle produce just as much as the Punans.
   A Chinese girl of 18 ran away from her father and step-mother because of ill-treatment and it was thought at first that she had made away with herself, but she was found on the third day. Her uncle, brother of her father, sued the step-mother for cruelty and proved enough to have the girl taken out of her father's custody and put into his own until her approaching marriage with a man in Kuching to whom she is engaged. The stepmother had been warned by Government once some years before because of her cruelty to the girl.
   In consequence of a report from the Chinese registrar the earth close to a dis-used well that used to belong to the house of one Wee Kee, who mysteriously disappeared some seven years ago, was dug up on the 20th. The skeleton of a man was found there doubled up, the skull being split on the left side. At the time Wee Kee vanished his wife and two men were detained on suspicion of having killed him, but released as no body could be found.
   One mail was brought from Kuching by the p. s. Adeh on the 6th and she called again at Kidurong on her return journey on the 12th. The motor tug Miri came in twice, on the 4th and 13th.

   By the 28th all channal marks had been destroyed by the persistent rough weather we have had lately and there will be no chance of replacing them until a calm spell comes on.
   The prisoners were employed on the roads, chiefly that from the fort over Tanjong Batu on the way to Kidurong, and on caulking the Government barong which had was quite unseaworthy.

Q: What measures were taken regarding jelutong permits in November 1919?
A: In November 1919, there was a readjustment of permits concerning jelutong work. Permits that reserved jelutong only were called in and cancelled. Only those who actually worked with jelutong would be granted permits, but these permits would only allow as much jelutong as each headman and his party could comfortably deal with.

I, myself, am not an old member. I refuse to be classified "old." And why not, since the Doctor said " General Service ” in 1915, and I've been at it ever since. No, most certainly am 1 not an "old” member. But I remember the Club in the days when nobody would dare have greeted me with “ Cheerio old Fruit.”
There was something about that expression which I disagreed with. Not on any personal ground, mark you ; I think it is because it is not meant. That is, I do not for one moment think that, literally speaking, you could apply such a term as “Old Fruit" to any clubman. But it were belter left unsaid, if it is not meant. There is one more difference between the young and the old members. Now Browne did mean whatever it is in his greeting that makes you know and feel that he ignores you and your existence. But Jones and his cult cannot possibly mean their new fangled greetings and speech. And yet the incident above related was prompted to my mind by the very difference 1 have sketched, which occurred at the Club on the occasion of a Service Dinner, given by General Bone-Warrier to celebrate the re-union of members once more returned to civil strife from the gates of the enemy. I remember now, yes, it is highly probable, come to think of it, that these boys (we older members always refer to them as boys), do mean something or other by their wanton misuse of English.	
About 280 gentlemen sat down to dinner, given by the dear old General, and the Club was alive with various uniforms. Quite a number were Royal Air Force Officers, (who mostly turned out on parade in top-boats and spurs; which I could never under¬stand, because, as far as I know no Aeroplane re¬quires touching up on its flanks when charging the enemy; at least, some Cavalry Officers I know, told me so.), and there was Jones, a nice lad despite his behaviour to me, in that new breezy manner of the day.
He was a flying man—a pirate or a pilot, I don't know what it is. He must have been a somebody —something,you know what I mean—a thingamebob, in the Flying Corps, because several Flying Corps men were placed a long way down the table, and be was only 2 removed on the General's immediate right flank. In fact— yes that is it. He was a leading Flanker in Squad formation in his Corps, and I know he holds a rank of something equivalent to a Colonel in the very old Army. I sat next him. I am a modest—or was a modest Battalion Com¬mander. He was full of chat. I spoke but little. The wine was good ami the Joint of the choicest— in fact the Quarter-Master of the 281st Battalion Fusiliers supplied the Joint, Oh no. you don’t get joints like it, except in the Army. Perhaps, some¬times, in the Navy. But then—the Navy,
well nobody notices what goes on in the Navy these days
Jones actually told me he was in a quandary about what dress to wear tonight A military gathering, and he, of all people, the young blood ; the obno¬xious young blood, did not know what to wear. But on resuming his tale of such a regrettable taste, he explained. It appears there was a standard uniform in the old R. F. C., but on joining forces, and amal¬gamating the Naval Air. Service and Army Ait- Service, a dispute arose as to colour and uniform. The army airmen were all in favour of khaki, but not double-breasted tunics The naval men required blue with reefer jackets. General somebody attended the Admiralty one day at a meeting, and Vice- Admiral something attended the next meeting-well Jones says it was dispute not a meeting—at the War Office. A terrible antagonism arose in the ranks of the amalgamated service. When he told me this, it explained what I had never before quite understood, and that is why was that ugly office called the War Office? Now 1 know. At any rate, Jones said they decided io mix the colours. So a forem n dyer was sent for, and he blended Khaki and Blue to show them the result, and the Navy men went into hysterics
What” they cued, "Wear that never-before-seen shade of sky-slate-grey-blue? !!!
"Never. We could never take our wives to Mar¬shall and Snelgroves, shopping, without being asked what frills we required for the sleeves and pockets.!!”
"A very poor argument don't you think, old bean? Fancy, and they the Navy—had the cheek to try and put the muff on our eyes by hiding behind their dear little cherry lipped Strawberries." said Jones to me.
“By hiding behind what?” I gasped.
" Their wives, my dear peanut ; wives" explained Jones.
"Oh!" said I. not comprehending the relation between wives and the Cherry Strawberry things Jones had referred to.
Jones went on to explain how, eventually, the Army "allowed" themselves to be talked over by the Navy, and some kind of uniform decided upon for both services I forget what it was, but there was a difference anyhow. The way he put it, was. “We agreed to spin straws with the ' Blighters,' and dub ourselves with the 'dear old glad-rags’ which suggested the sweet old 'daisy days’ of the Cherry peckers" !!’

Q: What led to the disagreement between the Army Airmen and Naval Air Service over uniform colors?
A: The disagreement arose when the old Royal Flying Corps (R.F.C.) merged with both the Navy's Naval Air Service and the Army's Army Air Service. The Army Airmen favored khaki, while the Naval Air Service preferred blue uniforms with reefer jackets. To resolve this issue, a dyer was brought in to blend the colors resulting in a shade of sky-slate-grey-blue. However, the Navy found this new color unacceptable and made fun of it, leading to an argument between both sides over which uniform color to adopt.

It is learnt on almost the highest authority that, by the time this issue appears, a startling innovation will have taken place in the Kuching telephone system. In con- sequence of the departure of a number of experienced operators it is said that it will no longer be possible, for some time to come at any rate, to ask the exchange for a name instead of a number. The age-old practice of twisting the handle, lifting the receiver, and muttering down the mouthpiece. “Sam- bong Tuan Mack” will, except of course in the untroubled out stations, become a mere memory.
It can be easily understood that there are far more important things for the new operators to remember at the outset of their careers than the particular relations of numbers and names It is indeed a matter for astonishment that their predecessors became so skilful in this peculiar branch of their work. Occasionally of course confusion occurred. Mr. Mack of the Bank had to be distinguished from Mr. Meek of the Govern- ment by saying “Tuan Mack Benk” or “Tuan Meek Perentah” as the case might be. On the whole, however, the system worked surprisingly well, and it was not the least attractive of the idiosyncrasies that have always distinguished Sarawak from
other countries. With loving care the Post Office authorities produced year after year before the war a diligently compiled and beautifully printed volume entitled “Kuching Telephone Directory.” Not only were the names of the persons in possession of the two hundred and more telephones in the town carefully set out. but on one page the Directory contained an injunction in heavy type: “Tell the Operator the number, not name, of the Subscriber to whom you wish to speak." But it takes more than the Postmaster-General to upset accepted con- ventions in Sarawak. In spite of this succinct instruction it is doubtful whether half the “subscribers” ever knew their own numbers, let alone anybody else’s.
The first post-liberation number of the Directory has recently appeared and, unlike its predecessors, it is probable that it is going to be used. It is to be hoped, how- ever, that this is not the thin end of the wedge, and that Sarawak is not going to be forced in all matters relating to telephony to adopt unfamiliar methods. We remember with no little appreciation the night, more than eleven years ago. that duty compelled us to sleep in the 10th mile police-station. As we composed ourselves to repose below the office table, we were rudely disturbed by the Corporal in charge ringing up Kuching Central, and instructing the operators.that on no account whatever were they to connect any caller with the station before dawn, as there was a tuan slumbering underneath the telephone.
It is hard to believe that there is really room for two opinions on the telephone in principle. It is without doubt the greatest curse in an age of accursed inventions.
“Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
Will hum about my ears:”
says Caliban, and who has not felt the same grievance? When one's telephone rings and wafts over the air the familiar voice of X. one feels a kind of spurious gratitude to the machine, as it means that X will not appear in person, but X's fathers, and grandfathers, and great-grandfathers would have written what they wanted to say and so should he. The telephone has developed an entirely new jargon of its own. It can
views the development with caution. It is difficult to be a suffragette before there is a suffrage, but there are many fields in which an organisation of women can play a great and invaluable part.

Q: What change was expected to occur in the Kuching telephone system on April 1st, 1947?
A: It was expected that there would be a startling innovation in the Kuching telephone system. Instead of asking for names, one would now have to provide the number of the subscriber they wished to speak with due to the departure of experienced operators who were skilled at connecting calls based on names alone.

OYA AND DALAT.
January, 1932.
The Acting Assistant District Officer, Mr. N. E. Hughes, reports: -
General. -The month was distinguished chiefly for execrable weather. It started to rain on New Year’s Day and continued without ceasing day or night until the 4th; as a result of this, the Oya river rose and Dalat was completely flooded, the water at one time standing ankle deep inside the jail. When the water eventually subsided the whole station was left with a top-layer of soft mud several inches deep. The roads are still impassable, and the padangs are marshes.
Reports from up river say that the floods did considerable damage to the padi crop in the lower Oya. The floods at Dalat were the worst since 1918, the water reaching to within a foot of the 1918 level. Until about the 25th a strong north-east gale blew steadily, bringing bursts of rain at frequent intervals.
I returned to Dalat with Mr. E. M. Woodward, Acting District Officer, Mukah and Oya, on the 2nd Mr. Woodward left for Mukah on the 4th.
Visitors to the station included the Rev. Fathers Buis and Van de Laar, who came to Dalat from Kanowit via he Bunau, Paku and Ulu Oya. and the Rev. Mother Ignatius, Superior General of the Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis.
Police. -The new police are making good progress, and drill at Oya, under the superintendence of P.C. Tapa, is already surprisingly good. Drill at Dalat was hindered by the floods, since even when they subsided the grounds were in such a state that drill outside was impossible. Instruction, however, was carried on in the office, when opportunity allowed.
Prisons. -Prisoners were employed on the upkeep of the station, and on repairing the damage done to roads by the bad weather. Discipline was good.
P.W.D. -The jail fence was completed during the month at a total all-in cost of about $200.
Erosion at the Kuala is still troublesome, but on the advice of the natives the shore at the crucial point was trimmed to a gentle slope; this, since it does away with overhanging edges, certainly seems to have a good effect, and subsequent rough seas have done less damage then previously. The work was carried out by the kampong people.
The roads at Oya were much damaged by constant heavy rain, and were repaired temporarily where possible. Extensive repairs will be carried out in the dry season.
The Government wharves both at Oya and Dalat were badly damaged by the floods, and will have to be taken down and re-erected again as soon as the weather becomes normal. The groins at Or a and Dalai stood up to the floods well.
Lands. -All field work at Dalat was held up for most of the month by the floods. The Land Inspectors continued their plotting, and helped the clerks in the office. Some work in connection with estates was carried out at Oya.
Thirty-seven summonses for non-payment of quit rent were dealt with during the month. Since the majority of those summoned were Melanaus who are entirely dependent on their rubber gardens for support, the prospects of recovering this money are not very bright. At the same time, over 140 quit rent defaulters were interviewed during November and December, so the balance of tax outstanding is not so bad as might have been expected.
Staff. -Charles Law, Court Writer, Dalat, left for Sibu on 2nd January on his retirement from Government Service. His place was taken by F. M. Umpi who arrived at Dalat from Balingian on 31st January.
The post of Liko Native Officer was abolished as from 1st January, 1932. Alek bin Ikok, the holder, reverts to Tua Kampong, Tanam.
Wan Hussein, Native Officer, was employed at Dalat all the month since the weather was too bad for upriver travelling.
Shipping. -Two motor schooners and three schooners entered, but they were unable to clear until the end of the month.

Q: What was the impact of the floods on Oya and Dalat in January 1932?
A: In January 1932, heavy rain caused the Oya river to rise, resulting in complete flooding at Dalat with water standing ankle deep inside the jail. The roads became impassable and padangs turned into marshes. This was reported as the worst floods since 1918.

When the extra two-day meeting for the benefit of the Jubilee Recreation Fund was cancelled in February owing to the condition of the course it was decided to compensate for this fixture by add¬ ing the odd day to both the Spring and the Autumn meetings. Only once before has the Turf Club staged a three-day meeting, in 1924, and it was not altogether a success. As was marked at the time, by the third day "the ponies had no wind and the punters had no money left.” It must be remembered too that there were fewer ponies in training and of a poorer class than the ponies racing to-day. The meeting just concluded, on the other hand, can be written down as a decided success. Fields were satisfactory, racing was of good quality, and last but not least, there seemed to be plenty of money about. The Clerk of the Weather was in holiday mood, and although he gave us a warning with a light shower on the first and second days, conditions were excellent both above and underfoot. Four records were lowered. Bintang putting up a new record for the 6 furlongs, Sintak Bulan for 3 furlongs, Happy Bay II for the 4 1/2 furlongs and Jubilee, for the Round the Course. No more remarks need be made about the going, the course was in excellent condition. His Highness the Rajah and Astana party were present at all three days and at the conclusion of the meeting His Highness very kindly distributed the prizes. The destination of the Champion Cup for the best performance at the meeting was in doubt to the end, but went to Abang Suhai’a Manis by a very small margin with the Datu Patinggi's Jubilee, runner-up. The Jockeys’ prize was deci¬ ded by the very short head which divided Medin and Asing in the last race. A full description of the racing and results will be found below. In conclusion this opportunity is taken to thank all those (and their number is far greater than the average race-goer realises), whose efforts went to make the meeting the success it was in whatever capacity they were kind enough to offer their services.—(Contributed.)

At the five furlongs the order was Happy Boy II, Bintang, Silver Blaze and King Kong with Kijang tailed off. King Kong moved up at three furlongs but was beaten coming into the straight. Happy Boy If maintained his lead but the weight began to tell just inside the distance and he was unable to answer a strong challenge from Bintang, who incidentally was not particularly fancied by his connections. 1 length, 1/2 length.

Miri Amateur Dramatic Society.
"MIXED GRIM,."
Nothing is more depressing than an inferior mixed grill, which usually consists of about three meagre ingredients. The Miri Dramatic Society, however, gave us a most generous “Mixed Grill” on 14th July, containing nineteen ingredients, all of which were, as its previous production had been. “Just the Stuff.”
It is impossible to consider all the artistes and items separately—equally impossible not to comment on some of the more outstanding ones. Mrs. Bettany was prominent as usual throughout the programme, excelling herself in vocal and yet more in facial expression ; as Mr. St. John Ervine would say—"an actress, ladies and gentlemen!” Mr. North, as the licensed buffoon of the gang, filled the gap left by the enforced absence of Mr. Stickland from the cast. We must add in passing that Mr. Stickland's speech on behalf of the Organ Fund formed a delightful and unexpected addition to the “Mixed Grill.” Mrs. Bishop’s wit and quickness in duet and dialogue and her general versatility makes her a most valuable member of the Dramatic Society. On course "Solly and his Piano” are always a joy. We only regret that approaching home leave will so soon deprive us of the pleasure of hearing him again for some time.
A mere enumeration of the parts played by Mr. Harry Bishop before he even appeared on the stage, to wit, producer, stage manager, musical director, part author, designer and painter of scenery, fill us with amazement and admiration— add to these that he acted, sang, and danced, with equal ability thoughout the evening and it is easy to see that he was the pivot and mainspring of the whole performance. Needless to say his task was made easier by the talent and energy shown by each member of "the gang” and especially by that of Mr. Saker. on whom, as accompanist, there rested such an almost continuous burden of responsibility.
From previous experience we expected at least one outstanding decorative number—we got it in "Honeymoon Lane,” with its charming Dolly Vardon costumes and picturesque setting. When "Melody Land” opened with “Ole Man River” sympathetically sung in a partial darkness, admir¬ably suited to the haunting wistful melody, we began to feel that a new and especially attractive departure was being made with negro spirituals, but alas! the scene ended in a blaze of light and a blare of hackneyed jazz.
Perhaps we laughed most over the "Three Spinsters.” Mrs. Bettany, Mrs. Bishop and Mrs. Kerr, made three ideal spinsters, and this number was probably the hit of the evening.
The four sketches though played with much spirit, and often amusing, were rather too trivial and slight. Mention should be made, however, of the two “Ladies of 'Oxton” (complete with pails and scrubbing brushes) ns cleverly portrayed by Mrs. Bishop and Mrs. Stickland. Messrs. Bettany and Pracy as the husbands of these two "ladies” took their parts well.
Mr. Andrews’ songs were much enjoyed, especially "The Wheel-tapper.”
Mr. Bishop announced at the end of the show that the next venture would be a straight piece (or rather a crook drama) and we much look forward to seeing a fuller display of histrionic talent that has so far been given rather tantalizingly little scope.
On Saturday the 28th July “Mixed Grill," with several fresh ingredients, was again presented in honour of the Hon. and Mrs. T. G. Cochrane, who have just arrived in Miri. The show was received with even greater enthusiasm than on the previous occasion.
As an extra item Mr. Dickson showed the very interesting cinematograph picture which he took of the launching of the No. 2 A Sea Line.
It was announced during the performance that the Organ Fund Appeal had resulted in the whole of the $700 needed being subscribed.
“Mixed Grill” was undoubtedly a great success and we hope that the next production will be given as soon as possible.
Mr. Harry Bishop and his "gang" have our best thanks for this excellent show.—(Contributed)
British North Borneo.
The ninety-first half-yearly meeting of the British North Borneo (Chartered) Company was held on July 17, at Biver Plate House, Finsbury Circus, E.C.
After Mr. Cecil F. Collins, the acting Secretary to the Company, had read the notice convening the meeting, Major-General Sir Neill Malcolm, K.C.B., D.S.O. (President of the Company), who was in the chair, said, in the course of his speech : It is a great satisfaction to me to be able to meet the share¬holders of this company with a statement of accounts which—(or the first time since I have had the honour of being your President—shows a very satisfactory profit. Last year—that is, for 1926— you will remember that we had a loss of over £2,000. The accounts which are before us to-day show a realized profit of more than £56,000, which has been arrived at after writing down the value of our telegraph system by the substantial amount of £10,422 7s. 5d.,and making full and proper provision for every form of depreciation.

Q: What was the main reason behind the success of "Mixed Grill" performed by Miri Amateur Dramatic Society?
A: The main reason behind the success of "Mixed Grill" performed by Miri Amateur Dramatic Society was due to its diverse and generous selection of nineteen ingredients, all skillfully executed by the talented cast members. Additionally, the variety show included a delightful speech from Mr. Stickland on behalf of the Organ Fund, outstanding performances by Mrs. Bishop in duet and dialogue, Solly's piano skills, and Harry Bishop's multifaceted roles as producer, stage manager, musical director, part author, designer, painter of scenery, actor, singer, and dancer. The show also featured a hit number with the "Three Spinsters" portrayed by Mrs. Bettany, Mrs. Bishop, and Mrs. Kerr.

Mr. J. B. Archer, Resi¬ dent, Third Division, accompanied by the District Officers, Sibu and Lower Rejang, paid a call on His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief which was returned on board s.l. Chamois. H.M.S. Falmouth then proceeded as far up river as Gunong Ayer, Admiral and Lady Little transferring to s.l. Chamois in which they went on to Sarikei: they returned to H.M.S. Falmouth the same evening. H.M.S. Falmouth reached Pending at 3 p.m. on January 31st. She was met on arrival by Mr. A. W. D. Brooke and His Highness the Rajah’s Aide-de-Camp, who had travelled to Pending in H.H.M.Y. Maimuna. which was used to transport Admiral and Lady Little and the officers of His Excellency’s staff to Kuching. As the Maimuna passed Fort Margherita a salute of fifteen guns was fired from the Fort battery. The Maimuna then anchored opposite Astana and was hoarded by Mr. W. F. Dick, Acting Govern¬ ment Secretary, and Mr. E. Purnell, Treasurer of Sarawak, who took Admiral and Lady Little ashore in the Siamese State Barge. After inspecting a Constabulary guard of honour which was drawn up on Astana lawn, His Excellency was received by His Highness the Rajah, who wel¬ comed him in the presence of a gathering of a number of senior officers and heads of various communities. Tn the evening a dinner, followed by a dance, was given at Astana for the Commander-in-Chief and officers of H.M.S. Falmouth. Thirty petty officers and ratings were entertained in the Rest House and the Sylvia Cinema by courtesy of His Highness the Rajah. On the following evening a most enjoyable dinner party, which was attended by Their Highnesses the Rajah and Ranee, the Astana party and about six other guests, was given on board H.M.S. Falmouth, which sailed for Singapore at 8 a.m. on February 2nd. During their visit to Kuching Admiral and Lady Little were the guests of Their Highnesses the Rajah and Ranee at Astana. Their visit was greatly appreciated, and it is regretted that the navy can only find time to come to Sarawak at such rare intervals. Films of the Month. JANUARY AND FEBRUARY. The bill of fare at the Sylvia Cinema during the past two months was varied enough to suit all tastes, since it ranged from H. G. Wells’ vision of the future through drama and light comedy to musical extravaganzas and song-and-dance shows, with one or two Wild West pictures and Tarzan thrown in for good measure. Artists included Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Ronald Colman, Robert Montgomery, Gigli, Wallace Beery, Jessie Matthews, Sonnie Hale. Joan Crawford and Ray- mond Massey. The combination in The Shape of Things to Come of Britain's finest imaginative writer and her most imaginative producer promised great things, and this promise was fulfiilled. H. G. Wells and Alexander Korda are an ideal team for a picture of this nature. which more than lived up to expectations. The story relates the progress of a war which ends Western civilisation and plunges the world into chaos from which it is rescued after many years by a group of practical idealists who succeed in bringing about Mr. Wells’ dream of a world state. It is a mighty theme and it was handled with a fitting grandeur. The opening sequence showing the outbreak of war was magnificent, and one which the leading politicians of every country should be forced by law to see every morning and evening of their lives. We were shown ‘Everytown’ on the eve of war, and the producer captured admirably the happy-go- lucky "It can’t happen here" atmosphere which, in spite of the complacency of the ordinary citizen, was threaded with a sinister counterpoint of ten¬ sion and distrust. The sudden outbreak of war was very well done; the air raid scenes were strikingly realistic, some of the stills being almost unbearably poignant. After the first smashing blows of the war came the long period of devastation and despair in which what was left of humanity huddled together in the ruins of towns and villages, still senselessly fight- ing, until dispersed by the advent of the 'wandering sickness.’ This part of the film was enlivened by the splendid acting of Ralph Richard¬ son as the pinchbeck Dictator rallying his ragged and starving subjects with all the rubbishy clap- trap with which we are already uneasily familiar. His portrayal of ‘‘the Boss" was first-rate satire, and this film will not, we fancy, be shown in Rome or Berlin, Laughter is the bully's most deadly enemy, as Messrs. Adolf and Benito are very well aware. The last part of the picture, though a triumph of production, was somehow not quite so satisfying. After half-an-hour of the aseptic palaces of glass and chromium in which our descendants of 2060 will live, one longed to take off one's boots in the back parlour of a thoroughly unhygienic seaside boarding house, put one’s feet up on a horse-hair sofa, swill guinness out of a bottle, belch, bombard the aspidistra with shrimps’ heads, and read aloud the racing news

Q: What was the event held for Admiral and Lady Little during their visit to Kuching?
A: During their visit to Kuching, Admiral and Lady Little were guests of Their Highnesses the Rajah and Ranee at Astana. They attended a dinner followed by a dance, which was given in their honor. Additionally, thirty petty officers and ratings were entertained during their stay.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, JUNE 1, 1927.
   In the middle of the month Mr. Allman, Superintendent 
of Rubber improvement Fund, and Mt. Hui at. Assistant 
Superintendent of Rubber Improvement Fund, 
unexpectedly arrived at Betong in the m.l. Para and a 
couple of days later I accompanied them on a visit to the 
Ulu Baku. P. Ijau's house was reached the first day. the 
launch itself reaching S. Plawa whence a transfer was 
made to the O.B.M.B. Biji in which the journey was 
continued to Mat up. The last house up the Paku was 
reached the second day whence a return was made to 
Senunus to spend the night. Mr. Allman found that the 
Dyaks have still much to learn- about the preparation of 
rubber and an instructor, Bet, was left behind at Samo to 
start on the work. During the walk up the river P. Ijan's 
posts were seen that he intends using to build his new 
house. These are cologsally lareg. A man's arms could not 
span one round. At Penom the framework of the new 
house is complete. Here again the posts could each be cut 
into four or five decent-sized posts. This, it would seem is 
the new sport in the Paku, since Luta built his, to outdo the 
last man in the magnificence of one's new house, but it is a 
little extravagant with the limited supply of belian Another 
thing that is seen with regret, especially around Betong and 
in the Paku, is the hold spirit-drinking has on the Dyaks.
   On the 20th Rev. Archdeacon Champion visited 
Belong, returning after two days.
   At the end of the month a policeman was sent to the 
Ulu Layer to arrest a man for non-payment of fine He was 
met by six armed Dyaks who refused to allow this and was 
obliged to return empty handed.
   Agriculture. - There were 109 permits to plant rubber 
and three permits to plant pepper issued during the month.
   Shipping. Twelve motor boats arrived and cleared the 
port during the month.
   Trade.-Returns as follows :-
    
   The Court Writer, PUSH, reports:-
   Court.-Very few cases were brought up for hearing 
during the month. The following persons were dealt with
   Two lads, Kucheh and Bunto, were each sentenced to 
one month for theft. Johari of Kampong Serabang for theft 
of padi was sent to Kabong to tie dealt with by the Acting 
District Officer, there he was sentenced to three months' 
imprisonment.
   Antek of Kampong Manggut for "Paternity'' was fitted 
thirty reals and three sukus and to pay the usual brian and 
blanja to plaintiff.
   Debak.- Fines reported by P. Mon. Seman was fined 
ten catties for slander, Jimbau and Leka (f.) were each 
fined twenty catties for adultery.
   Fined by the Native Officer.- Kalo fined fifteen reals 
for obtaining money under false pretences.
   General.-I proceeded up to Betong on the 6th with 
accounts and cash tor the Betong Treasury. March cash 
balance transferred amounted to $2,703.55, returning on the 
10th.
   Endawi Gelanggang was installed at Debak on the 14th 
as a Court Writer there.
   Contractor Mohamat has started the building of the Clerk 
and Native Officer's Quarters at Debak; and is expected to 
come down here as soon as the framework of the houses at 
Debak are erected, that is to say early next month.
   I went to Debak on the 20th, after banding over to Court 
Writer Endawi all outstanding work, returning here on the 
24th.
   Dresser Juluis Chung arrived from Belong on the 22nd, 
and treated Dyaks with N.A.B. injection for yaws. He left 
for Kabong on the 26th.
   Forest Guard Mahmudi arrived from Kabong on the 
23rd. After measuring timbers, and collecting royalty on 
same, he proceeded to Debak on the 26th, returning here 
again on the night of the 30th.
   Owing to the annual pengerih season very few Malays 
are left in the kampong, they having gone to Samaludam.
   Driftwood in the Rimbas is bad and it makes it very 
difficult for even a small boat to push its way through
   A long drought prevailed here, and lasted very nearly a 
month. The want of drinking waler was felt very badly.
   P.C. Suntong's first agreement of four years expired at 
the beginning of the month, and he has now signed the 
second agreement. He has drawn the $40 bonus as laid down 
in Order No. VII, 1927.
   Agrtculture- .-One sago planting permit was issued 
during the month. Dyaks have just about finished harvesting 
their hill padi. Halfway up river, Dyaks reported a very good 
crop of padi. Down river the crop is repotted to be a failure 
owing to a pest called the empango. which destroyed the 
padi.
Health.--Health of the district has been good.
   Trade and Shipping.-Exports on rubber have greatly 
increased, due to the motor launches calling in here 
declaring goods which they have shipped from Spaoh. 
Formerly they never did this, and in consequence the returns 
were considerably down last year.
   M.S. Bintang Trang called here on the 29th and 
proceeded to Betong. When returning from Betong she will 
proceed to Debak, and in future make a regular trip to that 
station.

Q: What were some of the issues faced by the Dyaks mentioned in the texts dated 1 June 1927?
A: Some of the issues faced by the Dyaks mentioned in the text include their need for further education on rubber preparation, the hold spirit-drinking has on them (especially around Betong and in the Paku), and difficulties with limited supply of belian wood for building new houses. Additionally, during a particular month, they were affected by a pest called empango that destroyed their padi crop downriver.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, AUGUST 2, 1926.	201 
"The Assistant District Officer, Mr. E. V. Andreini, reports ns follows :—
  I left Sibu on the 12th, accompanied by Abang Enjah, Native Officer, arriving at Kanowit at 6.30 p.m. where I spent the night.
  I left Kanowit at 10 a.m. on the 13th and spent the night of 13th at Sandom's house.
  The 14th and 15th were spent travelling and I arrived at Bunya’s house on the 16th where Bunya totally denied that he had told anyone that Penghulu Kana was on the warpath. I then proceeded to Penghulu Assun's house where I spent two nights collecting the Tuai and investigated the source of the rumours and their consequences. It appears that one Abut of S. Langit in the Second Division arrived at Empili’s house also Second Division with 14 followers armed with spears and shields and told Empili that Penghulu Kana had asked to go on the warpath; the rumour spread round and three days later one Jenapi who lives in a small house in S. Metan in Third Division saw smoke which he thought was that of a "bala” and ran with his family in panic to Empili’s house the people of whom bent the “tawaks” and started “tawaks” going in Ulu Julau and surrounding country. Scouting parties then went out including one of 41 men under Garen and thoroughly searched the surrounding country and returned thoroughly disappointed. I sent Empili’s son Banyoi overland with a letter to the Resident Second Division concerning those in the Second Division and have brought those concerned on this side down to be dealt with here.
  I spent the 19th and 20th visiting houses up the Entabai as far as Endu's house in the Klentong and went up the Klentong as far as Bukit Balking.

  The next morning I got boats and went down river visiting all the houses en route and arrived at Penghulu Merenggai's house the same evening. The people here are all split up in small houses and there are seven houses above Penghulu Merenggai on the main stream and many in small side streams. I have brought Penghulu Merenggai down with me to consult with you on the distribution of these houses and other matters concerning the Ngemah.
  I fined several tuai for disobedience of penghulu’s orders and held several minor cases, staying two days at Penghulu Merenggai’s house where I collected after some difficulty most of the tuai.

  During the month the number of cases of typhoid have appreciably increased. 10 having occurred with 3 deaths; all steps are being taken to prevent any spread, but with the primitive sanitary conditions, any prophylactic measures must of necessity be of an extremely simple nature.

Notes and Comments,
The Annual Report for Sarawak, 1947, has been published and is on sale at the Government Printing Office for the modest sum of $1.50. This is the first handbook of its kind to be published since the Liberation and it includes, as an introduction to Part I, a brief account of the conditions here before the war and of the events leading up to the cession of the State to the Crown. The book is well illustrated with excellent photographs.
The Chinese in Kuching celebrated the anniversary of Chinese Victory Day on the 3rd September. The bazaar was decorated with flags during the day.
His Majesty the King has been graciously pleased to approve the following award :—
Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (Military Division) Lieutenant B. J. C. Spurway.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies has made a Colonial Development and Welfare Research Scheme in favour of the Government of Sarawak providing a grant of £8,040 towards the cost of the appointment of four officers to carry out socio- economic research in Sarawak.
Dr. Edmund Leach who visited Sarawak during 1947 and who travelled extensively throughout the country making plans for a comprehensive Socio- Economic Survey has written a detailed report. Dr. Leach has recommended several research projects. Four of these are to be undertaken now and are referred to as the Iban project, the Land Dayak project, the Melanau Sago project and the Chinese project. The research projects are intended to be confined to the interaction between social and economic forces and to provide the Government with data for gauging the probable local response to the various schemes of development now under con- sideration. Such research may also suggest new lines of approach to various types of previously intractable administrative problems.
Dr. Ju-K’ang T’ien, who has been appointed to undertake the Chinese project, arrived in Sarawak on the 2nd September. He was bom in China and attended the National Normal University (Department of Education) Peiping, and the National Southwest Associated University (Depart- ment of Philosophy and Psychology) Kunming. He also attended the University of London (the London School of Economics and Political Science) during 1945-48 as a post-graduate student preparing for a Ph. D. degree.
Dr. T'ien has had teaching experience as Head- master in Provincial Ling-ang Senior Middle School. Yunnan, and was Lecturer at the National Yunnan University. He has also undertaken research work in China.
The Kuching Municipal Commissioners have been considering a recommendation for the re-institution of the pre-war time gun. The gunpowder situation is easier but the cost of replacing the pre-war gun would be about £100.
It will he recalled that before the war time signals were fired at 5.00 a.m. and 8.00 p.m. and to announce the arrival of mails with occasional feux-de-joie on high days and holidays.
Apparently it was the custom to ram a wad of turf down the muzzle preparatory to firing; it is reported that, on one occasion, a stone got mixed up with the turf and a pedestrian on the far bank of the river was sharply rapped by the stone when the time signal was fired.
No hard feelings were entertained over the incident but the pedestrian remained convinced of the deadly accuracy of the cannon fire.
Sir Henry Lovell Goldsworthy Gurney, k.c.m.g., former Chief Secretary to the Palestine Govern- ment, has been appointed High Commissioner for the Federation of Malaya.
The new High Commissioner was born in 1898 and entered the Colonial Service in 1921. After service in Kenya and Jamaica, he became Chief Secretary to the Conference of East African Governors from 1938 to 1944 and from that time until 1946 he was Colonial Secretary of the Gold Coast.
Until the end of the British Mandate in Palestine, Sir Henry was active in promoting truce negotiat- ions between Arabs and Jews.
The death of Peter Johnston Stewart, who retired from Sarawak in 1928, is reported from London.
Mr. Stewart entered the Service in 1902 and was attached to the Government Workshop, Kuching, later being transferred to Brooketon Collieries. His service was broken during the first World War and he rejoined in November 1920, retiring from the position of Superintendent Engineer in September, 1926.
Although aged seventy-two at the time of his death, he had enjoyed excellent health during his retirement.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies has intimated that with the Prime Minister's approval it was decided to include a Colonial representative in the United Kingdom delegation to the forth- coming session of the United Nations General Assembly as an alternate delegate. It is intended that the Colonial alternate delegate should deal specifically with Colonial and Trusteeship question at the Assembly and its various Committees.

The Editor,

S. THOMAS’ SCHOOL,	
12th June, 1933.
SIR,
In the Sarawak Gazette of June 1st, it was interesting to read that one Mohd. Nor was believed to be the first local Malay boy who had passed the Cambridge Preliminary Examination.
Ethnologically, however, the names of: -
Kassim John Nichol
Juing Insoll
Matthew Basi
Saban Brandah
Juan Michael
Augustine SiRau 
Nais
may be of even greater interest, as they are true-blooded Dyaks, who have recently been successful in the examinations.
Kassim John Nichol in spite of being in hospital for over three months last year, passed the higher examination in December, having been successful in the Preliminary together with Juing Insoll and Saban Brandah in 1931. Matthew Basi’s name was published in 1930. Augustine and Nais are Land Dyaks from Quop and Duras and are the first Land Dyaks who have satisfied the examiners.
Yours faithfully, 
F. SEPTIMUS HOLLIS.

!Q: What were some notable achievements of local Malay boys in passing Cambridge Examinations mentioned in a letter to Sarawak Gazette?
!A: In the letter from S. Thomas' School, it was noted that Kassim John Nichol, Juing Insoll, Saban Brandah, Matthew Basi, Augustine, and Nais were some local Malay boys who had recently passed Cambridge Examinations. These achievements are particularly interesting as they represent the first local Malay boys to do so, with others like Kassim John Nichol also overcoming significant challenges such as being in hospital for over three months last year while still passing the higher examination in December. Additionally, Augustine and Nais were the first Land Dyaks from Quop and Duras respectively who managed to satisfy the examiners.
