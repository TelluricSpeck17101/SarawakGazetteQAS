POLICE NOTES.
ON 8th. ultimo at midnight the house of a Chinaman named Tow Kuang Meng situated at the 1 mile, was broken into and attacked by a gang of eight robbers, the only male adults being Tow Kuang Meng and his father Tow Ah Sa. These two men put up a splendid resistance, although wounded ; and owing to the prompt way in which the neighbours turned out on hearing the alarm, and the vigilance of the police stationed at the 7th. mile; six suspicious characters were arrested, four of whom are suffering from severe wounds.
The Chinese living in this district are to be congratulated on the way they turned out, some watching the principal paths, others proceeding to the spot to render assistance ; evidently a pre-arranged plan in case of any trouble and acting upon advice given them recently by the Government.
If men would render such ready assistance in the event of any future trouble ; gang robbery would entirely cease.

ON 15th. ultimo a matter which might have proved serious, occurred between the Sikh community and a Malay in charge of buffaloes tethered opposite the Sikh temple.
One of these beasts died, whereupon the Malay in charge began to cut the carcass up in full view of, and in close proximity to, the temple ; and although this man was told by one of the Sikhs that such action was strictly against, the Sikh religion, and was also requested to desist, he foolheartedly continued to cut it up with abuse, causing immense illfeeling amongst all the Sikhs who became temporarily of a dangerous disposition.
This is not likely to occur again as a promise has been given that in future, no blood of any animal shall he shed on this spot.
DURING the night of the 19th., a quarrel took place between some Tamil coolies employed on the Astana Farm ; one of them by name Vilain, being stabbed in the back. The wound seemed, at first, to be serious, but the medical report, is at present, satisfactory.
Arrests have been made and an enquiry is being proceeded with.
SEC and Extra Sec" wines are regarded as safe in gouty folk. Yet gout is an acid plethora in the blood : and acid or dry, or sec champagne, that is wine to which hydrochloric acid is added by the French on purpose to please the English tastesuch wine is adding but fuel to the fire, acid in the wine to an economy already loaded with acid : a condition of things which carries its own punishment.
The French do not drink sec' champagne, but wine that is neither sweet nor acid, but neutral. This wine does not cause headache next morning. nor does it produce gout. (The Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.)
THE Rev. Archdeacon Small came up from Labuan to make his headquarters at Jesselton for some months, Mrs. Small having arrived about a fortnight ago. We offer them a welcome here. (B. N. B. Herald 16th. Oct.)

Football Competition.
Abang Sulieman bin Haji Taha of the Land and Survey Department has been kind enough to offer for competition, a set of 11 Silver Medals to be played for in a Football Tournament held in honour of the safe return of Abang Haji Abdillah from Mecca.
Those teams who are willing to enter are kindly requested to send in their names to Messrs. O. Lang and E. W. Howell who will act as joint Honorary Secretaries during the Tournament.
Only such teams as are composed of bona fide Government servants (not earning daily wages) may enter, and each team shall pay to the Secretaries when sending in their mimes an entrance fee of $1.50.
All teams must wear distinctive colours.
The Tournament will start on 6th. November 1920, and the Secretaries shall be empowered to arrange the order of the play, and their decision as regards any dispute shall be final.
The following have consented to act as a Committee and will arrange necessary rules, etc.

Sarawak Regatta.
A meeting was held in the Resident's Office on the 25th. October to discuss arrangements for the forthcoming Regatta on New Years Day.
Inchi Abu Bakar commenting on the expense incurred in racing long boats and the difficulty of finding boats in Kuching capable of making any show against the boats and crews that came from outside, suggested that some means might be adopted to ensure that at least His Highness the Rajahs cup might be retained in Kuching.
The meeting was of opinion that His Highness would prefer that the cup race should be open to all comers.
1. It was derided that there shall not be less than 4 entries to justify races for His Highness the Rajah's cup.
2. The handicap for the 15 men race shall be the deduction of 3 paddles from the previous winner and 2 paddles from the second boat.
3. The handicap for the 30 men race shall be the deduction of 4 paddles from the winner of the previous race and of 2 paddies from the second boat.

CANNIBALISM RIFE.
THE following are some extracts from an article which appeared in a recent issue of The Economist. The figures were taken from The Bankers Magazine and illustrate what has happened since the beginning of the war to the market valuation of various classes of stocks and shares.
In normal times the figures compiled by the Bankers' Magazine are revised every ten years or so, in order to keep the valuation of securities well up to date and thoroughly representative of market movements. The last revision was made in 1907, that list being retained at present in order to maintain the continuity of comparison. The list comprises 387 representative securities, whose market value on January 20, 1907, the date on which the list was
Oceanic steamship Sonoma after one years travel in Japan, China, India, the Straits Settlements and Borneo for the Southern California Academy of Science and Explorations and the Universal Films. As an indication of what may be expected, the Los Angeles men recounted the following experiences:
The skipper of a small Dutch trading schooner became intoxicated and wrecked the craft on a reef, compelling the Americans to make their way ashore on the north side of Borneo in the ship's dingy.
PARTAKE STRANGE FOOD.
Upon landing the travellers were surrounded by Kia Kia's, a tribe of head hunters, and secured respect by knocking out the chief and eight of his warriors by punching them on the point of the chin.
As a token of respect the ship-wrecked scientists were then presented with a strange dish, which they did not relish, and therefore ate but little, and were then presented with a score of human heads, one of which was from a girl (sic.) who had suffered the supreme sacrifice a few days previously.
The adventurers then proceeded to film a tiger hunt, and one of the huge beasts broke through the jungle and attacked Alder, who placed two well- directed shots before the animal struck the camera. The machine was smashed, Aiders leg was beneath the tiger, and the episode was registered by the second camera operated by Leammle, who is the nephew of Cull Laemmle, president of the Universal Company.
Alder said:
One gets used to little experiences of that sort in an expedition into the byways of the world. We are returning with many rare specimens that will be interesting to the Academy, These include, in addition to the heads, a lot of truck presented by his majesty. the King of Borneo, and the Prince.
The eating of human flesh is still in vogue among the Kia Kias of Borneo, and every effort to stamp the habit out has failed of success. The Europeans are practically safe, however, because the natives fear reprisals if they attack the whites. The daughter of one of the chiefs took a fancy to my assistant, Laemmle, and the old fellow suggested that as a son- in-law the nephew of the Universal Films would do nicely.
We expressed regrets and got away with our loot. I will travel and lecture in the principal cities for a year and will then make another trip, this time to the South Seas, for fresh material. ---(B. N. B. Herald.)
The Decline in Security Values.
4. Entries for the coming Regatta will close on the 20th. December and places for competing boats will be drawn on December 29th. Any boats entering between the 20th and 29th. December will have to pay double entrance fees.
Mr. P. M. Adams kindly consented to act as Hon. Secretary and Mr. Hayward as Hon. Treasurer. A vote of thanks to Mr. K. H. Gillan for acting as Hon. Secretary during the past years was proposed and carried.
The meeting then terminated.
Warning to Planters.
Prussic Acid in Rubber Seeds.
Mr. Harold North of Dunally Group Galaba, Ceylon, writes to the Ceylon Observer, as follows:A woman perfectly well when leaf was weighed up at 10.30 a. m. and who had no previous illness for over a year, suddenly developed violent symptoms of colic and died at 1.30 p. m. the same day. An inquest was held and evidence was given that the woman bad eaten a number of para rubber seeds I ordered a post-mortem and the D. M O.s evidence was to the effect death was due to poisoning from an organic substance which acts primarily on the nerve centres. I then sent some para seed to the Government Analyst and attach a copy of his report.
Poison.
Report on the result of the examination of the contents of a parcel sent me by Mr. Harold North, J. P. U. P. M. Galatia, with letter of the 14th. instant. The parcel contained some rubber seeds. These seeds contain hydro-cyanic acid ( prussic acid). The amount in the seeds was estimated and they were found to contain sufficient of this poison, which acts on the nerve centres, to account for the symptoms and death.(Sgd.) C. T. Symons, Government Analyst.
The Wild Man of Borneo.
The following gem, culled from the pages of the San Francisco Chronicle of May 7th. 1920. has been sent us by a correspondent who also hails from God's own country He writes, It would seem that North Borneo has been ineffectually explored hitherto if a so called scientist can heroically land on its coasts and immediately find tigersto say nothing of Kings, Princes and a new tribe of Nativeor that San Francisco is, in places, alarmingly wet'! AN ADVENTURE IN BORNEO IN WHICH A PERFECTLY GOOD AMERICAN movie machine wan smashed by a tiger, who was killed by W F. Alder, just as the attack was made. The animal jumped twenty feet and had died from the effects of two bullets by the lime he landed upon the camera.

revised, was 3,843 millions. What has happened since then may be seen from the following figures:
Million .
January 20. 1807	3,843	...	100
December 18,1913 3.841	...	87
April 20,1918	2,572	...	67
November 19, 1918	2,822	...	74
July 19, 1920 2,395	63
The highest point touched during the period covered by the figures was the starting-point in 1907, and down to the time of the Armistice the lowest was on April 20, 1918, one of the most critical times of the war.
As regards individual groups of securities, it is found that the severest decline in market value has taken place in fixed interest-bearing securities. In the tables which follow, the valuation of December 18, 1913, has been taken as 100 in order to show the percentage decline which occurred down to the date of the Armistice, and again since that time. The first table gives the movement in the valuation of gilt-edged securities:
the falling away in iron, coal, and steel shares since the war is rather remarkable.
Taking the total value of the 387 securities on December 18, 1913 as 100, the value on November 19, 1918, works out at 85, and on July 19, 1920, at 72.
The greatest resistance to the decline is shown by Colonial Government stocks. It must not be forgotten that the list was compiled in 1907, and the first item therefore does not include any of the war loans. Corporation stocks, both home and overseas, show the same movement. Foreign Government stocks, which undoubtedly include several German, Austrian, and Russian securities, naturally show the severest decline.
Turning to railway stocks, we find the following movements:
Here we see Home Railway ordinary stocks almost down to the level of the fixed interest prior charge stocks Railways in British possessions show an extraordinary decline, probably owing to the movement in Grand Trunk stocks, but American railway securities have changed very little since the Armistice. There can have been very few buyers except the Treasury during the war, but the gain on exchange in dividend and interest payments doubtless accounts for steadiness since the Armistice.
Some interesting changes are shown in the next table, which gives financial and industrial securities :

DEAR SIR,
You have no doubt learnt from the Straits Times and other foreign papers of the great famine in North and South China. The situation is so serious that many millions of these unfortunate inhabitants are now suffering from want of food and other necessities.
They have cried out Help ' Help !! Help!!! or we perish, and we people here have looked on without moving a finger or giving any response to their cry of need and help.
Are we so unsympathetic and selfish that our conscience or better self is not pricked within us to stand still and see these our countrymen slowly dying from starvation.
Our brothers in Singapore and the Strait Settlements are now trying their utmost to collect subscriptions to relieve these starving people, and their

about equidistant between No. 9 mine to the west and Sual, to the south-east and a temporary footpath was made and a coolie line built at a convenient distance to the new work and water supply.
Full advantage has been taken of the local topography, whereby a complete extraction of the No. 2 seam underlying the Ngili Hill to the dip of the north crop can be obtained. These mines are designed to have double the out-put capacity of the present mines under similar geological conditions, and the producing stage should be reached by the end of 1922, which will be approximately simultaneous with the exhaustion and consequent abandonment of No. 8 and 9 mines.
One bilian house was completed for the Malay employees in the new quarter and four old Malay houses and another two-storey building occupied by the Chinese, was dismantled.
The rainfall for the mouth was 877 inches and water supplies were regulated almost up to the end of the month.
The padi has been transplanted from the nursery into the adjoining fields and appears to be growing well. efforts have not been in vain. The amount they had collected on October 19th. is about $70,000.
Now ! this is the opportunity for us Chinese, especially the leading influential Chinese Towkays here in Sarawak, to show our united sympathy towards these famine stricken people ; first to organize a Famine Relief Commitee, second that pamphlets printed in Chinese and English about the great famine should be circulated freely to inform the public, for no person is fool enough to give out money of his own free-will, unless he understands thoroughly for what purpose or cause the money is used, and third to subscribe generously towards this fund.
Yours, etc.,
A CHINESE.
The Chinese Chamber of Commerce have issued the following appeal outside which states : This is to inform the public that there is famine in the seven provinces Chili, Honan, Shantung, Shensi due to dry weather. In the South. Fukien, Chekiang, Yunan due to floods.
The famine districts involved are many thousands of miles. The inhabitants, who are destitute and starving, are many millions, there are many who have commuted suicide to avoid death by starvation. These sufferings have never happened for hundreds of years in China. Now as the winter is coming, the sufferings will be greater and unbearable. The foregoing are reported in the Chinese and foreign papers, and we have received many telegrams from the affected districts describing the horror and sufferings of the inhabitants which the pen is unable to describe.
At a committee meeting of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, held on September 25 it was decided to call a meeting at the Chamber in which the representatives of all branches of trade, workmen, schools, press, charitable institutions, guilds, associations and libraries and clubs are invited to send representatives to the local Chinese Chamber of Commerce to discuss this matter and to collect without delay subscriptions to help to relief hunger and cold which affect the millions of population in the seven provinces of China. We sincerely hope the generous public of Singapore will respond to this good and charitable work of saving lives.(Straits Times.)
The quantity of coal in stock at the end of the month was 907.13 tons.
Everything went well in the various departments during the month.
On the completion of the survey, a site was selected for an Adit and two new drifts at a point
September.
Courts ---The Courts were kept fairly busy during the month and a large number of eases were settled.
Considerable time is taken up in bearing Chinese disputes which might have all been avoided had deeds been drawn up by the parties concerned, but these Chinese appear to have some objection to registering deeds and trust to verbal arrangements which invariably lead to the Courts and are the cause of much illfeeling.
Public Works.The new quarters for the wireless operators were completed and taken over. A new house for the cowman has been built and the cowshed put in a fairly good state of repair. The new barracks were whitewashed and also the Dispensary, and repairs effected to No. 2 bungalow.
The extension to the Treasury offices has been finished by the contractors and taken over.
The foundations for the new bazaar lumps were laid down, piles being driven 12 ft. to carry concrete, and all these lamps will be in working order next month.
The Tamils have been raising roads and clearing out ditches but heavy rain interfered very considerably with outdoor work.
As bilian ataps were not obtainable here the s. I. Chamois brought back 125,000 from Bintulu. These ataps are of excellent quality and very different from the rubbish worked by the Kanowit Dayaks.
The Rangers topped the big ansana trees near the fort which were getting top heavy. A big blow might easily bring them all down and cause considerable damage to property.
General.I returned from Oya in the Chamois on the 3rd. Mr. and Mrs. Mead arrived from Kuching the next day in the Alice Lorraine. Mr. Mead came to start the Forest Department in this division where it is badly needed. Had such a department been in existence ten years ago much of the wasteful felling of valuable timber which has taken place would have been prevented.

tall ansana trees near the fort were stripped of many of their branches but, though smaller ones fell on the fort roof no damage was done. Considerable damage was done to the rubber plantations.
Accompained by the Conservator of Forests, Mr. Mead. I visited Bintulu on the 8th. returning on the 13th. There appeals to be a large body of excellent coal there the seams out-cropping on the main river close to the kuala. With coal at its present price these might be worth investigating.
The body of Ah Hong was found floating in S. Assan on the 8th. A number of deep cuts inflicted by a parang were the cause of death which had taken place some two or three days before. Two arrests were made, one being released again after enquiry but the other remains in custody as further investigations are being made concerning him.
The s. s. Batavier arrived from Singapore early in the month with her boiler leaking. She loaded her cargo and at the request of the owners, tried to leave, but had to return as the trouble was too serious and awaited the arrival of boiler makers from Singapore who arrived by the s. s. Flevo on the 27th. The vessel was under steam at the end of the month ready to leave with the Flevo early in October. She has recently been thoroughly over-hauled and refitted in Singapore
Owing to the Flevo having had to be docked and the Batavier laid up here, communication with Singapore for the last two months has not been such as would be calculated to advance the interests of the community here, while the Government revenue also suffers. Supplies ran short in the bazaar with a consequent rise of prices and it is much to be regretted that this growing district should have to rely on the erratic running of these two small and anti-quated vessels for the whole of its import and export trade.
The Alice Lorraine left for Kuching on the 18th and Mr. J. B. Archer, who has not been at all well lately, left by her to go on short leave.
The s. s. Sarawak arrived on the 19th. Mr. Carpenter having been appointed to Mukah left for that station in the s. 1 Mermaid on the 27th and Mr. Horton, who relieves him here, arrived from Mukah on the return trip of the launch.
The 27th., being the anniversary of the birthday of His Highness the Rajah was observed as a holiday.
I visited Kapit the 27th. in the Alice Lorraine which had brought 100 tons of coal from Sadong for the Government. She loaded 300 bags of padi and other cargo for Kuching and returned to Sibu on the 30th. leaving for Kuching the next day.
The Dayaks have all been busy planting their hill padi. A hot spell during the month gave them the chance of burning off their clearings and for some days the atmosphere was thick with smoke. The burning off has been most successful.
The swamp padi had a good start and so far everything has been in its favour. It is all looking well.
Owing to the lack of a proper Land Department at Sibu, with consequently no survey, land grants have been burned promiscuously in the past.
Apparently any Chinese can grab any area they please plant it up in any way they please and then apply for a grant, which is given them. The consequence is that granted land is dotted all over the country, while along the river banks the granted land is continuous with no reserves for roads, and the owners of such land are in a position to hold up all the jungle inland.
At some future date some of this granted land will probably be needed by Government which will have to buy it back at the owners price, which will not be a low one.
BINTULU.
August.
Tubau. I left for Pandan and up-river stations on the 4th. accompanied by Native Officer Abang Naga, and returned to Bintulu on the l2th.
At Pandan I found the frame-work of the clerks house had been erected, but owing to the lack of material the work was at a standstill. I promised to have some nibong worked at Kidurong and proposed that bark should be used for the walls as soft-wood planks are unprocurable. While at Pandan the heads of the Dayak houses in the Sebauh and Pandan were called and informed that their choice of Jalin as Penghulu had been approved by His Highness the Rajah. (This man now takes the place of ex-Penghulu Beti, dismissed in February ).
I spent one night up the Pandan at the house of Untol. At Tubau 'I'. K. Passu reported a great deal of sickness amongst the Kayans, six deaths having taken place just before my arrival. As a consequence few cases were heard. Farming lands, claimed by Dayaks, were examined in the main river and in Sungei Genaan. In the case of Manang Langah no excuse could be found for his encroachment and he was evicted; in the second case Rirang was found to have farmed in the same place for three years and he was left in possession, while the question of a site for his house (22 doors) was adjourned for consideration.
Court -Two cases only call for mention. Sloh (f) vs; Remang, a claim for division of property after divorce: $120 was awarded to the claimant in full settlement. Sabah (a Dayak) head of a mixed house of Kayans and Dayaks, was sentenced to imprisonment for receiving into his house a Kayan after leave to do so had been refused by a former Resident.
The Land Officer now has instructions to leave road reserves of 22 yards width every 800 yards along the river banks, the reserves to be carried straight inland as far as necessary. Existing grants are having these reserves marked in them.
The whole land system here requires to be put on a proper footing and the lack of the necessary staff to do this is severely felt now and will be regretted in the near future. The few coolies with the one Malay Land Officer are totally inadequate to deal with the matter.
Since the padi mill has been taken over by Government, 2,790.53 piculs of padi have been dealt with. This amount could have been doubled had we the necessary hulling machinery. If next year's harvest is a good one the mill will not be able to handle a fraction of the padi brought to it. A large padi mill here would pay well.
There has been a good deal of sickness in the district recently dysentery and diarrhoea. This seemed to appear with the sudden change of weather but towards the end of the month it appeared to have lessened somewhat.
The rainfall amounted to 12'60 inches.
The low price of rubber has hit the Chinese planters badly and many gardeners have sold their gardens for what they could get and returned to China. A large number of gardens are no longer being tapped and stocks of rubber are accumulating, a rise being expected before the end of the year, 25 cents a katty only is being paid for sheet rubber of rather poor quality.
