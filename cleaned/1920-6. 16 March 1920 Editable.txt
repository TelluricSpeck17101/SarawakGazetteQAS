The New Club.
?
A Meeting was held at Kuching on 1st March to form a new Club to take the place of the Ranee's Club which was dissolved on 16th February 1920 Bishop Danson was in the Chair.
Two letters from H. H. the Rajah were read setting out certain conditions to be observed in the formation of the New Club aud sanctioning the transfer to it of the assets of the late Ranee's Club.
A statement of the accounts of the late Club showed a credit balance of $431.91 and in addition to this it was stated that there was $350 odd on deposit with the Borneo Company Limited.
The Meeting decided to form a Mixed Club with an entrance fee of $2 and a monthly subscription of $1 the latter to be paid by Outstation Members when in Kuching for any part of a month.
A provisional Committee was elected consisting of Mrs. Danson, Mrs. Mead. Capt. Cunynghame, Mr. Mead and Mr. W. Skrine, (Hon. Sec.). This Committee was instructed tn carry on the Club and ? to call another General Meeting early in April.
In the mean time it is hoped that any persons wishing to become members of the New Club will submit their names to the Honorary Secretary as early as possible, together with any suggestions they may have as to the management of the Club. Subscriptions or Donations may be sent to the Cemetery Clerk, The Diocesan Registry, Kuching.

?
The Christian cemetery in Kuching is managed by a Board, consisting of the Resident of Sarawak Proper, or his nominee, the Vicar of Kuching, the Manager of The Borneo Company, Ltd., Kuching. and the Churchwardens of 8. Thomas' pro-Cathedral.
Its up-keep is paid for by burial fees, and subscriptions.
These latter are at the present considerably reduced through the departure of many former residents of Kuching, and the cemetery funds are in consequence small.
We therefore ask the present residents to come to our aid by putting their names down for annual subscriptions, so that the cemetery may be maintained in its present efficient state.
DALAT, 18th February, 1920.
The Editor,
Sarawak Gazette.
Kuching.
SIR,
May I point out that your reference to the Oya crew in the Gazette of 2nd January was not quite accurate. The crew of the Sri Pelandok was composed of two-thirds of Sarawak Malays and one-third Dalat Melanoes. The boat, however, was built by Melanoes, and, as your correspondent Owner" is, I suspect, well aware, has before now proved herself capable of a considerable turn of speed even with a mixed crew of paddlers. Owner was apparently a little upset when he wrote his letter. He seems to be under the impression that in praising the Dalat boat you were depreciating the efforts of the Simanggang men, but I tail to see any suggestion of this in your account of the Regatta.
I am as anxious as Owner" professes to be to see the two peoples meet on equal terms, and in order that this should be possible suggest to the Regatta authorities that the Kuching Boat Races should be held at a time of year when boats from Outstations some distance up the coast can reach Kuching.
Under the present conditions it is only because of the energy and enthusiasm of Owner" that Kuching owners do not pocket all the prize money.
I am a poor man, and my desires outrun my means, but I am prepared to open a subscription list with the sum of $10 in order to bring about a meet THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, MARCH 16, 1920.	73
ing between the Simanggang and Dalat crews, and trust that Owner" and other boat racing enthusiasts will help me to attain that end.
Yours faithfully,
REV. BERN. MULDER.
OYA,
Chinese New Year, 1920.
TJie Editor,
Sarawak Gazelle.
DEAR SIR,
I agree with Owner" that the statement in the account of the Kuching Regatta with reference to the Dahn Meianaus was rather sweeping and considering that few people in Kuching have seen Melanaus paddling perhaps the opinion expressed was not justified.
As far as I know, anyway in latter years, the only time Melanaus have paddled against other crews was at the Sibu Regatta in 1913 when the crew from Dalat, paddling in a temoi, beat everything else on the river; and later on in the day paddling in a Sibu boat which had come in last in her other races, brought her in first amidst great excitement. Perhaps it is not generally known, however, that the crew of the Dalat boat was not composed entirely of Melanaus; in fact the majority of them were Sarawak Malays. If the Kuching Regatta was held during the fine monsoon it would give other stations n chance of sending boats down to compete against Kuching. In that ease I would lie willing to send a Dalat boat and crew down and race with any Simanggang boat. If Owner" will put in a word perhaps something might be arranged and the argument as to who are the better paddlers could be settled on the river instead of on paper.
I am, dear Sir,
Yours faithfully,
J. BEVILLE ARCHER.
Th,- Editor,
Sarawak Gazette.
DEAR SIR,
It seems a pity that Owner" should read into your account of the Sarawak Regatta published on January 2nd a depreciation of the Simanggang crews and boats which it surely does not contain. Owner complains of partiality, a quality from which I doubt if his own letter is quite free. You Sir expressed an opinion that the Dalat Milano are the best paddlers and boat builders in the country. Owner" seems to think that the Simanggang people are superior to them in both these accomplishments. Nobody who knows them will deny that the Milano of the upper Oya are unusually handy at either boat building or paddling, and, since seeing the Sri Belalang crew's style on her first visit to Kuching, I have always been of the opinion that, if the Malays of the 1st Division will not learn to paddle in the same way, an upper Oya crew stand more chance of heating one from Simanggang than any other.
The pity is that Kuching regatta is held at a time of year when it is practically impossible to get a
large boat there from a distant part of the coast. Unless and until this regatta is held during the calm weather it is unfortunately not likely that Simanggang and upper Oya crews will meet and settle the question.
I am, dear Sir,
Yours faithfully.

MONTHLY REPORTS.

February.
The month of February has been a very dry one, only 5'88 inches of rain being registered: but it has been a splendid mouth for the quick ripening of the padi crops, and I believe that a great proportion of these has been harvested.
Early in the mouth the price of fish was considerably reduced. I found that one man had signed agreements with natives to supply him with fish No. 1 at 12 cents per catty, No. 2 at 6 cents and No. 3 at 3 cents, but was retailing this at 24 and 26 cents. 18 cents and 12 cents respectively. The price has now been fixed at No. 1 18 cents, No. 2 14 cents and No. 3 10 cents per catty.
I regret to report the death of Paul Hon the dresser in charge of the Government Hospital, who fell between the wharf and s. s. Sarawak, and was drowned. He was seeing some friends aboard the steamer, had placed two planks from the wharf to the bridge of the vessel, and was standing on these passing up bananas when the swift running tide caused the vessel to roil slightly, the planks slipped off the bridge, and he was precipitated into the river. This occurred about 7 p. m. of the 11th. The tide was running very strongly at the time, and as in falling his head came in violent contact with the side of the ship his chances of being saved were absolutely nil. Boats were sent out and divers employed, but his body only floated after the third day. His neck was found to be broken and the body considerably bruised.
Paul was a good dresser, did his work well, and was liked by all.
On the 13th I left for a visit to the coast stations Jaie and Sbangan. Mr. Haldane accompanied me, and the weather being fine we spent two days on Pulo Burong.
The Government house at Sbangan has fallen to pieces, and is so far beyond repair that I have ordered it to lie pulled down. There are sixteen fine belian posts, and a certain amount of other timber which will be most useful, and I have arranged to have it all brought up to Simunjan.
The furniture in the house had not even been removed : and there were four tables, two chairs and a bedstead in a building of which most of the floor had dropped out.
The S'bangan people who have paid no road tax for some years, and are therefore expected to keep the paths through their own kampong in some sort of repair, have done nothing of the sort; and if there were ever any paths at all, there are no signs of them now.
It is a pity that these Malays cannot be culled out occasionally and made to do this work, which
74
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, MARCH 16, 1920.
would be n lienetit to them but which they are too lazy to do of their own free will.
We returned to Simunjan on the 17th.
The 20th, Chinese New Year, was observed as a
holiday.
The 24th was Her Highness the Ranee's birthday.
A case of assault occurred in the bazaar on the 26th, all because some Dayaks were selling jelutong to one trader, and his neighbour was jealous.
The s.s. Flevo called here once and coaled, and Wee Yang Meng, representing the owmers, bought over two hundred piculs of jelutong from the bazaar Chinese paying as much as $19 per picul. The local price here at the time was between $15 and $16 per picul. Some pigs arriving from Kuching that day on s.s. Sarawak were transhipped and sent to Sibu by s.s. Flevo.
Mr. C. Gordon Dun of Messrs, the Sarawak Rubber Estates, Ltd., arrived towards the end of the month and together with Mr. Haldane proceeded to Gedong to search for land suitable for the purpose of planting pepper.
With the sanction of His Highness the Rajah, sentences of seven and five years imprisonment respectively were passed on Jong Tek Boi and Jong Jin Chong for assault and battery resulting in the manslaughter of Jong Ah Cheh at Tebekang during the month of January. The Chinese at that place were also fined.
Seven steamers and six schooners entered and cleared the port during the month.
There were 1,163 tons 15 cwt. of coal exported.

The gross out-put of coal produced by the mines during the month was 1,177-17 tons, of which 435 tons were consumed by our boilers and 742-17 tons delivered for export.
The shipments for the month were;
The Kuching Municipality 251-16 tons Messrs. The Borneo Co., Ltd. ... 470-19 ,,
,, The Sarawak Steamship
Company ... 260-00 ,, The British Malaysian
Manfg. Co.. Ltd. ... 24-00 ,, Soon Seng & Co. ... 157-00 Total shipments ... 1.163-15 tons
Coal stocks were exhausted by the end of the month, chiefly on account of the Chinese New Year holidays.
Towards the end of the month underground conditions in No. 9 mine were rapidly improving and
the out-put was on the increase.
The upper seam also produced well and the work
on the No. 8 mine fall made good progress.
Everything went well in the mechanical department and all the engines and boilers were overhauled and cleaned out during the Chinese New Year stoppage.
A large quantity of stone and mine refuse was dumped on the river bank at the wharf and the subsidence which had commenced with the high tides the previous month was successfully arrested.
A good number of piles were driven in at the up-river end of the wharf which had been rather badly damaged by the strong currents.
A very sad affair occurred on the night of the 11th when Paul Hon the hospital dresser fell into the river while attempting to put some goods on board the s.s. Sarawak, and was drowned. His body was recovered 44 hours later just above our timber landing on the up-river side of the wharf.
His loss is deplored by all the mine inhabitants with whom he was very popular and highly respected.
The rainfall for the month was 523 inches.

Court. Rather fewer cases than usual came up for hearing during the month. A number of durian tree disputes were settled at Dalat. These cases are difficult to decide upon as generally the parties are closely related and consequently the more bitter. In a sago land dispute. Ibih vs: Mariggali, where judgment was given in favour of the plaintiff, the defendant has lodged an appeal.
Dom was fined $25 for attempted swindle. Lungang and Menduri were sentenced to nine and six months imprisonment respectively for theft of jelutong, whilst both received in addition six cuts each with the rattan. Sago Hour and jelutong thieving is very bad it present and an example must be made. There were a number of prosecutions for evasion of timber royalty and convictions were obtained in all the cases.	General.I returned from Sibu on the 11th and found nothing of importance had transpired during my absence. The Oya Court Writer reports that on the night of the 4th a violent thunderstorm took place in Oya accompanied by strong winds. A number of houses m the kampongs were completely blown down and also the biggest plane tree in the Oya grounds: this in falling brought down a big casnarina tree. The gap made by the loss of these fine trees is very noticeable. On the 13th the Revd. Father Bernard Mulder of the Mukah Mission arrived en route for Dalat where he is, I understand, taking over from the Revd. Father Slotter who left for Kuching afterwards. Father Stotter has worked for a great number of years amongst the Melanaus both at the Cut Mission and at Dalat. In the face of many difficulties he has succeeded in doing a lot of good amongst that thankless race. Mr. R. D. G. H. N. St. J. Horton arrived on the 15th from Sibu en route for Mukah to which station be has been appointed. He left for there on horseback on the
17th. I went up to Dalat on the 18th returning on the 24th. During my stay there the whole place was flooded every day and constant rain fell. There were a number of cases for settlement. Most of the people were on their fruit groves and one hears that there is a good crop of fruit this season especially durian.
On the 22nd it was reported to me that the schooner Kim Hua Anu, 65 tons, Juragan Yahya, had gone ashore near the lighthouse whilst trying to enter the river.
There was a strong N. E. wind and for a time things looked bad. I ordered the local fishing fleet to put out to her assistance and she was soon surrounded by boats which took off part of her cargo. With further assistance she managed to get off again undamaged with the rising tide. It was a very near escape and had it not been for the remarkably high water that evening she must have gone to pieces.
H. Sulong from Mukah took over the duties of Court Writer at Dalat on the 30th and Wee Hong Kee left the Government Service on the 31st.

P. W. D., etc.The old cook-house belonging to the Oya bungalow was pulled down and erected in n new spot with the addition of a belian attap roof. The auxiliary telephone line from Oya to Dalat which connects Sibu with Mukah direct through the Dalat switch was found to be badly rusted in numerous places and was taken down.
The prisoners were engaged as usual on roads, etc.
Rice Control.-The local stock of rice was completely exhausted at the end of the month. A new system of registration has been inaugurated and will be put into effect at the beginning of next mouth. The rice cards have been prepared and we are only waiting for the rice, to begin.
Trade.- Raw sago and jelutong still command very high prices. Money has never been so plentiful amongst the Melanaus as at present and they boast of the exorbitant prices which the Chinese compel them to pay for very inferior goods. They will pay any price for something which takes their fancy and at times Three Castles Tobacco has changed hands at $5.50 a tin. The hardship falls on the pel sons with fixed salaries such as servants and Government employs who cannot hope to keep clear of debt.

January.
I returned from Sibil via Oya on the 4th of the month.
On my return the police reported that the telephone hue near Kampong Petanak had been cut during my absence, and about eight fathoms of copper wire stolen. The Tua Kampong was sent for and informed that, unless the thief was handed over, every man in the kampung would be fined. Eventually three men were found with wire in their possession, in one case the wire having been fashioned into a childs bangle, and in two cases into fishhooks. The three men were sentenced to terms of imprisonment. All kampongs have been informed that the inhabitants will be held responsible in future for thefts of telephone wire near their village
if the thief is not produced.
Proceedings were taken by twelve natives, who had padi farms at or near Tanjong Basong on the main river, against the three owners of buffaloes on the cattle-ground there. The buffaloes had broken down the belian fence and had trampled through the farms, doing considerable damage to the padi then nearly fit for harvesting. The police estimated the damage done at $300, but having myself walked over the farms, I found that this estimate was very excessive and reduced it accordingly. The owners of the padi near the fence were not fully compensated as they were guilty of negligence in not taking any precautions to prevent the fence being smashed.
On the night of the 9th, Friday night, the Government vice store was broken into and two sacks of rice removed in addition to the belian sate kept there. The thieves were evidently under the impression that the money was handed over on Saturday morning us was formerly the case, but this custom having been altered some time ago they
only got some $3 fnr their trouble. The safe was found broken open on the hank of the river the following morning. No trace has been found by which the persons concerned could be recognised, but it is certain that a number of men were in the gang.
The guard of Hangers sent to Balingian in December returned to Mukah on the 25th, there being no necessity for them to remain longer at Balingian.
It has been impossible to help Balingian with rice from here as the sea has been too rough to permit boats leaving the river, but a number of Dayaks and others have arrived at Mukah overland and have been supplied. At the end of the month a boat came over and several bags of rice were sent for the bazaar Chinese. By the end of the month the Dayaks should have started their harvest, and things will be easier.
Reports from all over the district point to an exceptionally good crop this year; in fact Dayaks on the Mukah river say they have never seen such promising nadi since they have lived here. The up-river Milanoes are all busy on their farms and also report good prospects. The padi seems to have been exceptionally free from pests this year.
No schooners have been able to leave the river during the month on account of the heavy seas running on the bar. The wind changed to the west on the 25th and the sea went down, but only 5 to 5 feet of water could be got on the bar, and the schooners, in spite of part of the cargoes having been taken out, were unable to clear. Unless a channel forms later on in the year the sago trade will be very seriously handicapped. For the last two or three years the bar has tended to become shallower, and if this continues it will be necessary to resort to dredging in order to get cargoes out.
Mr. R. D. St. J. Horton arrived from Oya on the 17th instant, having been appointed to do duty in this district.
The sum of $39,000 was paid out to traders during the month principally on wireless advices from the Treasury.
