"CHANDU" by Owen Rutter (publishers T.Fisher Unwin) will interest most people domiciled in this quarter of the globe,the atmosphere of which is cleverly portrayed by the author.The story is a drama which,although quite possible,has fortunately so far as we are aware never actually been enacted in reality.It is a book,however,which should find a place alongside "Sepia," by the same author.
WE extend hearty greetings to Miss R.Silcock who arrived by the s.s.Kuching on the 18th to take up her appointment as Assistant Matron.European Government Hospital.
REV.J.M.Hoover,District Superintendent,Methodist Episcopal Mission,Sibu,passed through Kuching on the 22nd en route to the United States for home leave.
MESSRS.R.D.Binnie,Public Works Department,and R.V.Carr,Managing Director,Sarawak Trading Company,Ltd.,sailed for Europe on the 4th,the former on home furlough.
BULAN Puasa was concluded on the 3rd with the usual celebrations which were favoured with perfect weather,also was the following day,Hari Raya,when the customary visits were exchanged.
AT the invitation of Mr.and Mrs.A.M.Forrest a cheery party enjoyed a very pleasant picnic at Santubong on Easter Monday.
MR.J.B.Archer,District Officer,Sibu,and Mr.W.H.Jacques,Divisional Treasurer,Sibu,left for European furlough on the 18th and 22nd respectively.

SUMMER time in England commenced at 2 a.m.on 10th April.
IT is gratifying to note nowadays that where Chinese patriots fly the Chinese Nationalist ensign the Sarawak flag is to be seen alongside it.
THE Government Dental Surgeon,Mr.A.T.Partridge,L.D.S.,R.C.S.,accompanied by Mrs.Partridge and children,is expected in Kuching about 2nd May.
MRS.J.S.W.Bean and Mr.A.A.Rennie have kindly accepted the appointments of Hon.Secretary and Hon.Treasurer respectively of the Sarawak Library.
WE read in the First Division monthly report for March
:-
"In order to open up the land in the Sambir and Moyan districts,it is proposed to extend the existing drain to the "ulus" of the Nonok and Sampun rivers and eventually on to the Sadong river and 1 1/2 miles inland from this drain to dig another one of 15 feet breadth,joining up the Sadong and Samarahan rivers.The land in between this area to be divided into 20-acre lots.Cost of this scheme I estimate to be about $45,000 and will take the best part of 2 years to complete.The expenditure will be recovered from land rents.Mr.Miller-Hallett will be in charge of this work and hopes to start next month,when the weather should be more favourable."
MRS.Baird,wife of the Municipal Commissioner,left Kuching on the 28th for a visit to Europe with her child.
WE heartily congratulate Mr.and Mrs.H.
D.Aplin on the birth of their son.
MR.W.F.de V.Skrine has taken over the duties of the Department of Trade,Shipping and Customs from Mr.J.A.H.Hardie,who proceeds on home leave shortly.
THE usual Race Week "International" Football Match took place at Kuching on Saturday the 23rd when Scotland vs.England provided a most exciting game which was witnessed by a large crowd of enthusiasts.
The weather was perfect,but the state of the field left much to be desired from the player's point of view,being extremely slippery as the result of a heavy rain the night before.In spite of this,however,both teams showed remarkable energy and a very fast game ensued.
Tait scored in the first half for England which was shortly equalised by a hot shot from Macdonald.
After half time the game continued with unabated vigour,the ding-dong struggle ending,without further score,in a tie,one all.
Arrival of H.H.the Tuan Muda and the Dayang Anne.
His Highness the Tuan Muda and the Dayang Anne arrived in Kuching on the 25th instant,having travelled out from Europe on board P.& O.s.s.Morea and we take this opportunity of extending a special welcome to the Dayang Anne on the occasion of her first visit to Sarawak
His Highness the Rajah received His Highness the Tuan Muda and the Dayang Anne at the Astana landing stage,whether they had been escorted in the Siamese barge by Mr H.B.Crocker Acting Chief Secretary.
Having been greeted by members of the Supreme Council and the Committee of Administration,His Highness inspected the Guard of Honour under Major S.Cunynghame,after which His Highness and the Dayang proceeded to the Astana where other Government Officers and local residents were assembled to welcome them.

New Training Regulation.
SINGAPORE TURF CLUB.
WE were glad to note a new training regulation.All horses on training mornings now proceed to the course via a new path at the end of the paddock emerging on the track at the one furlong post when they turn to the right to commence their work.No horse is permitted to turn to the left on reaching the track
The effect of this new regulation will be times they even condescended to wave,because it was an easy courtesy,and did not cause them to apparent on the morning of a race day and descend from their exalted attitude,and because will avoid the dangerous practice of horses there was always the glorious awareness that they were on their way and need not stop.

"Dum Spiro Spero.
I believe there is a great deal to be said after all for the Harem system,and women are far more permanent and pleasurable concealed as it were from the public eye,than they are emancipating themselves in the professions and pastimes of man- kind.Besides which,they are safe; there is not the time for a man to get tired of his wife,nor the opportunity for another man to get attracted by her When 1 first went out to Sarawak women were of such minority that they were looked upon with a certain awe,and much assured disfavor. The men unhesitatingly gave us the impression that we were butting in on them.Husbands did not go about proudly with their wives,but apolo- getically,with one eye on the disapproving Die- Hards.Sarawak was a man's Arcadia,and the intrusion of women was looked upon as Sacrilege There were of course a fascinating few who drew men to their houses,but it needed courage,and a hide off which sarcasm rolled like the sweat from a Rickshaw Coolie's back.When I used to go out to a party,I found that automatically the men herded into one corner of the room,whilst the women huddled in the other.To cross the barrier was an act of independence no one so much as dared venture upon Sometimes I would move across with my heart in my mouth,for I was shy in those days,and address a remark,harmless enough, to a man about the extreme heat,or the annoying wet of the day ; not only because 1 felt it was my duty to make conversation but out of sheer curio- sity to see what would occur.So little did occur, that only too gladly I would drop back amongst
my admiring but ostracised sex,and the men look-
ed at one another wisely and murmured amongst
themselves "Poor thing,she does not know any.
better; she was brought up in London,so what
can you expect?" There was no such thing as a mixed Club in the days that I am writing of.The men had quite a little congenial Club of their own with a Tennis Court,whilst we had a minute affair with a
Verandah you could not swing a cat in,which they
called always with a touch of pitying derision the
Ladies' Club.There were absolutely nothing to do
there but sit and discuss the mw,which believe me
we did in no uncertain voice and in every varying
key.We could see the men passing along the road
in rickshaws,dressed up in white flannels and with
rackets in their hands,puffed up with satisfaction
and self-esteem.They saluted us smilingly,some-
Kuching from the Outstations.Men with more daring,and confident in the knowledge that they were only down for a week,and the consequence of their recklessness could not pursue them when they left.Two of them walked the plank so to speak and actually dared be seen about with the girl. One went so far as to make an appointment,indeed quite a number of appointments,on the Golf course ; and the other being Scotch and therefore cautious,met her at an angle of the Post Office where no one could espy them All of this 1 must tell you was fifteen years ago: to-day things are very different Half the men are married and only a very little group of Die-Hards remains.Still we have no mixed Club,although the carcase of an
immense and awe-inspiring building has begun to rear its unpopular heights upon the golf course, and as the New Club rises pile upon pile groans of the Die-Hards become louder and longer and more profound God knows I do not altogether blame them in London you can have an intrigue with a married woman without the husband's jaundiced eye lighting upon you,but out East everybody knows everybody else's business so much better than their own; there is always an under- current - wolves that set on your building romance and tear it limb from limb; crows that peck the flesh off a secret meeting,and leave the skeleton of it forever in your cupboard.1 rather agree with the man who said."Women ought never to be seen before 6 p.m.and then I do not want to see them."
Sarawak,unlike most Eastern places,is es- sentially a man's country,and I am not sure that when this quaint convention is broken,a little in- describable something special to it will not fall away from it and spoil ii.I myself am inclined towards the Die-Hards,in so much that 1 am fond of old-fashioned rules and regulations,and I feel so certain that once we arc let loose we shall exude everywhere.Like honey we may sweeten the lives of men,but like honey we clog and suffocate their taste for us In K.L.it seems to be so different: 1 have only been here a little while but 1 realize that woman is predominant.Of course the town is twice the size,and there are bunches of beautiful girls,and garlands of delightful women.If there are any Die-Hards,they conceal themselves so admirably that they are' unrecognizable as any- thing but lovers of the ladies.To 'Have a Heart"
He would at this juncture study your face and observing it to be meditative,us is only natural after this bit of information,smile knowingly.He is con- fident he has hit upon the truth.Yea,he has his reward; but on a little reflection you will recognize that this is hardly any remarkable feat in fortune- telling.
MAKING HIS MARK.
Every man in his vanity thinks that there is some- one who is just possibly jealous of him and naturally wishes him to the deuce.This is not,of course, uppermost in his mind; but it is nevertheless a dor- mant fact .Our amiable friend is a sufficiently keen student of human nature to realize that he need only voice a warning to confirm your dormant suspicions about that impossible fellow what's-his-name.But stay.He has not finished.
"Yon very good man,not care,nevare wishing anyone harm.You getting no goo-ood friendship, plenty good getting friends from you."
He tickles your vanity and gains his ground.He would now deferentially lay hold of your hands and gaze calmly at you.
"Now for money,you leetle deefil'cty," the man says gravely."But I tell you when you getting money,how much,where from,not long middle 1927."
A SAFE THRUST.
This tribe of Fortune-tellers are remarkable hyp- notists and possessing but a rudimentary sense of morality have no compunction whatever in imposing
A.0.F.B.
By the kindness of Blower H.B.Crocker,there was meeting of Froth Blowers at the Residency at 8 p.m.on Monday the 25th April for the purpose of forming a "Vat," with the support of "Lubrication in Moderation."
It having been ascertained early that there,were no communists,murderers,welshers,conscientious objectors or other vermin present,ejectment orders were unnecessary,and the Acting Deputy Unpaid Sub-Assistant Lance-Gargler's piffle-snonker remained sheathed and unblooded.
Ye Ancient Orders and Rules for the establishment of new Vats were then promulgated by Blaster Theo.E.Walsh,in accordance with the rites and usages of such assemblies,and the 300 odd Blowers present who could show no cause as to why they should not be fined,were duly fined,the remainder signing chits! As a result,the sum of $131 was available for remittance to Headquarters in London.
upon the credulous many.It may be quite correct that your finances are not all that they should be.This truth,however,is no testimony to his abilities
in fortune-telling.No man's finances are too sound these days.It is a universal fact that most people are perennially hard-up.Remember that the man is more or less of an expert in summing up human beings and is able to read character at a complete glance,and it will be a surprise to you no more that he has stated certain truths which may be universally applied.
He would have fixed upon you now the look of the brighteyed mariner who held the wedding guest.You are under his sway.He sees to it that you do not grow sceptical.He produces a bit of paper,writes something and folding it,asks you to hold it tightly in the palm of your right hand.
"I am Yogi-I can tell you everything.You thinking some flower name	think one flower
name-I tell you that name."

is the slogan of K.L.,and as far as I can see they live up to it each one of them: and what Sarawak wants is a ship load of girls then would the Die- Hards waver,and the crashing of their mighty fall would spread throughout the country,leaving per- haps one four at Bridge to say to one another "I am glad it was not like this in our day Fifteen years ago Sarawak was 'some' country" before the femi- nine species became supreme.'' [Straits Produce .]
The Itinerant Fortune-teller
The itinerant Fortune-teller is an amiable rogue.He is also a good psychologist.He likes to visit you only on a Sunday afternoon when,for that day at least,the wicked ramifications of your business affairs cease from troubling you and your weary mind is at rest.Stepping on to the cool of your verandah,he salaams you respectfully,fixing you with a determined look.A sense of annoyance might have assailed you had not a cool breeze swept your brow and you had found yourself passed into an angelic moon.
A stalwart son of the Punjab,he exhibits a perfect I set of dentistry,is amply built and cleanly dressed.A beard lends support to a dignified appearance.He strokes that fungus growth in an affectionate manner and pursues the usual preliminaries in quaint terms.
"I tell fortune Sir-very goo-ood,a I way correct,past,present and future.See Sir	"
And invariably a card is handed forth,it announces modestly but explicity that he is world I renowned and could tell any lady's past,which is rather rude; and any gentleman's future though in the nature of things,to take our enthusiastic social reformers at their word,it might lie better that he should not.
"Your s-star good s-star." proceeds the man with sibilant eloquence; and you straightway feel that it would be amusing at least to hear him.
"You got very goo-ood heart." he would say and leaning forward,whisper confidentially,"You must be leetle careful; you got one enemy,lie very jealous for you......at	present your s-star not shining.
Let us assume you thought of the rose.The man will then ask you to read the bit of paper he gave you to hold in your palm and you will,perhaps,lie surprised to learn that the word "rose" is written there.You might think that had you thought of the chrysanthemum,in view of the man's ignorance you might have floored him.Unfortunately,you must realize that you have but little option in the.matter.This is a case,undoubtedly,of hypnotic suggestion.
AN EYE ON THE FUTURE.
The man will now smile triumphantly and ask you for a dollar.He is ready at this moment to tell you all about that fortune you are soon to come in for.His solicitude is really amusing.The dollar will have exchanged hands and you will be asked to wash your hands thoroughly.You look forward eagerly now to the outcome.

"Middle 1927,your s-star shine.You will give Yogi present?"
When you assure him that you will,he puts a piece of paper in your hands,make you clench it tightly, and then taking the paper away asks you to glance at your palm.And behold! A figure running into four places is inscribed there in some mysterious fashion.That,the man remarks,will be the exact extent of your fortune-when you come in for it in middle 1927.
"You are very good man,your time coming,you get plenty money,lucky s-star soon shine."
The Yogi departs with many blessings and asks you not to forget him in middle 1927 when you get your fortune.
My own opinion of the prophecy would be,how- ever,that you should be prepared to wait till the Greek calends.-[The Strait Echo.]
Two Ways of Working.
not to trust to the inspiration under the spur of the last moment,but to look ahead,to prepare,and to undertake the important thing first.Above all,let them distrust the lure of the little thing,the doing of which is always pretending to be a preparation for the real work of the
day.Left undone these little things cither reveal them- selves not to need doing,or somehow get done,after all, in good time.Conscientiously performed they will swallow up a morning,a day,a lifetime; and,priding himself on his laboriousness,a man may go to his grave a trivial idler who has never made an effort and has left
his life's work undone.-(The Times.)
The Communist Element
We read in the report on the 73rd Ordinary General Meeting of the shareholders of the Chartered Bank of I.A.&C.,in London on 30th March:-
"We must also recognize what has led up to the present situation.The spirit of Nationalism,which was the outcome of education and residence in the West,was quite understandable,and could not be legitimately objected to.It has been in existence for a considerable time,has grown rapidly,and has permeated both North and South China.The danger arose when the Communistic element-the spirit of hatred-from Moscow pervaded the Councils of Canton.From this Communistic spirit of grown the intense anti-British feeling and the so-called spirit of anti-imperialism.
"An American writer,Mr.Silas H.Strawn,in an address before the International Chamber of Commerce at Colorado in December last has thus summed up his view of conditions in China after careful investigation of facts and from a fairly good knowledge of the conditions which he had obtained as a member of the American Group attending the Tariff Commission held at Peking in 1926.
"I therefore submit that anyone who has investigated conditions in China to-day must conclude that extraterritoriality,unequal treaties,imperialism,and the other slogans to which I have referred have nothing to do with China's troubles.These catch words are being overworked by the agitators,many of whom are Bolshevists,the politicians and the militarists to conceal from the long-suffering,patient and industrious people of China the pathetic fact that they are being impoverished and enslaved to serve the ambition of the warlords for greed and aggrandisement.
"These are striking words,and deserve attention."

The Sayings of Lao-Tze.
[To the Editor of the SPECTATOR.]
SIR,-Lao-Tze was a Chinese born some fifty years before the time of Confucius,who takes high rank as a profound and original thinker.In these days of "mothering" governments,the following extracts from his sayings make a special appeal.
"As restrictions and prohibitions are multiplied in the Empire,the people grow poorer and poorer.When the people are subjected to overmuch government,the land is thrown into confusion.When the people are skilled in many cunning arts,strange are the objects of luxury

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE,MAY 2,1927.
Sarawak Turf Club.
Spring Meeting,1927.
The first day of the meeting was favoured with perfect weather,an overcast sky without rain or glare.The track,however,was distinctly sticky as the result of two nights' min,ns a result poor times were recorded,except that of Burak m the race round the course,3 min.42
/5 secs.,the fastest since tins event was inaugurated two meetings ago.
On the second day the weather was also kind,being blight with a cool breeze.The track,however,was stickier than ever.
After the meeting His Highness the Rajah kindly distributed the Trophies in the Grand Stand,Malays,Chinese and Europeans all being represented among the winning Owners.Brahim was the most successful jockey with 5 wins and 1 second,while Burak,owned by Ali bin D filth,secured the Civil Service Challenge Cup for the best performance at the Meeting.
Thanks are due to Mrs.Chater and Mr.E.Banks for the capable way in which they superintended the arrangements for refreshments; also to the Band of the Sarawak Rangers which rendered musical selections throughout the afternoons.

J.A.H.HARDIE,
Honorary Secretary,Sarawak Turf Club.
Board of Trade,Rubber Exports Report.
Limbang.
The work of inspecting and instructing rubber gardens in the Limbang District was started on the 3rd January.Three instructors were brought from Kuching and a local man was also engaged.
On inspecting the rubber dealers and exporters in the bazaar it was found that all these shop- keepers kept proper records of all dealings and purchases they had made.If all dealers elsewhere so kept their books it would make very much easier the tracing of bad rubber.
The quality of the rubber was very fair.It was evident though,that too strong a solution of acid was being used The curing (smoking) however was good.This was a pleasant surprise as in most districts so far visited the inadequate or excessive smoking has been the chief fault in native-made rubber.
The type of smokehouse bring used was good, being very similar to the one advocated by the Rubber Fund as in use in the Saribas.The type is simply a plain house about 12 feet in height,the tipper half being allowed for the rubber,the lower part being for the fire which is sunk in the ground about two feet,over which are hung suitable baffles.As compared with the Chinese-made smokehouses,which have elaborate outside ovens made of brick and cement,the Fund type are simple,cheap and more efficient.
There were quite a number of smokehouses and more being erected.Where smokehouses were built too close to dwelling-houses owners were ordered to rebuild them further remote,being compensated for their trouble.
It was also pleasing to see the freshly-milled sheets were net being dried in the sun.As a rule the lesser faults,viz.,lack of sieving and use of excessive acid,the native producer seems to overcome.
The greater and more vital faults,viz.,
sun-drying and wrong procedure in curing,he does not seem to overcome,but in this district he has to a very great extent succeeded The reason for this must lie in the fact that there are several European estates in the vicinity and that the native has taken the advantage of following the correct methods employed on these estates.This is more than can be said of the Chinese close by Sungei Tengah Estate-this unfortunately to their own loss.
The amount of rubber being produced at present is not great,being about 150 piculs a month.A considerable area,however,is being planted and it is hoped that tapping on the younger areas will be better,the present work being pretty bad and cannot compare with the tapping,say in the Saribas where the Dyaks are most careful of their trees and check the work of their coolies.
On the whole it can be said that the rubber produced is very fair,being considerably better than most produced in Southern Sarawak.
The writer left for Lawas on 10th January taking two of the instructors with him Limbang was again visited from 14th to 17th February.
Lawas,Trusan,Sundar and Merapok.
These districts were visited from 15th January till 14th February.As in the Limbang district it was found that native rubber was very fair,in fact with the exception of Merapok rubber (a very small amount the curing was better than in the Limbang area,the sheets not being so heavily smoked.
These districts in all produce about 150 piculs a month.
Traders' books were properly kept and the system of Government Registration books lent it- self to easy location of gardens,being grouped under headings of roads and rivers etc.
At Trusan there are very few smallholders,most of the gardens being owned by Chinese towkays. The rubber was distinctly good.
The type of smokehouse is as in Limbang,viz., good.
The acid solution used was excessively strong; the correct strength of 1% was given to gardeners.
The Chinese dealers charge an exorbitant price of $1 and over for a quart bottle as compared with 65/75 cents elsewhere.
Acetic acid and sieves are being sent to Limbang and Lawas which will be sold at cost price.
Considerable further areas are being planted up. Tapping again is bad,especially on the towkays' larger gardens,their excuse being that they have not the time for supervision.In view of the fact that the life oi the older areas is numbered it is hoped that greater care will be taken in tapping so as to prolong the life of the younger areas
At Merapok the Chinese type of smokehouse was in vogue.These being built in a very dilapidated condition ; the Chinese agreed to rebuild them on the Rubber Funds principle.Plans were left with them.
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE,MAY 2,1927.	119
While in the Merapok district the writer took the opportunity of visiting the Merapok and Maragan valleys.The former,viewed from a hill under lallang,presented a wonderful sight,there being say some five thousand acres of undulating and flat land stretching up to the P.N.B.border,the greater part of the land being under lallang free of all slumps.The population is practically nil
The writer visited pepper gardens al La was and Trusan.One at Lawas had been almost abandoned but the vines carried a very good crop almost ripe,but with no signs of fresh spikes.Black fruit disease was apparent though not badly.At Trusan the garden visited was well kept and the vines were very heavily laden with fruit,also just ripening.The soil in both cases was sandy loam quite different from the usual "pepper" soil
Every facility was given to myself and instructors in carrying out our work and I have to thank the Divisional Resident and Acting District Officer for their assistance

Rubber Exports Report.
I inspected the rubber in bazaars at the following places,Sebuyow,Lingga,Bakong,Simanggang.Betong.Spaoh and Pusa.
Sebuyow.
There is very little mature rubber here,but quite a number of young gardens,the majority of which were planted during the last couple of years.The quality of the rubber in bazaar I found to be poor an' three instructors were put on to visiting gardens.
Batang Lupar.
This was my first trip to Batang Lupar and,although the rubber dealers nearly all said that the quality of the rubber is improving,I consider it will take some time yet to bring it up to par with Saribas rubber.There are hundreds of gardens of immature rubber here and 1 think that in three or four years' time more rubber will be produced in Batang Lupar than in Saribas.
Lingga and Bakong.
In the bazaar at Lingga I found a fairly large amount of rubber.In one shop there were about twenty piculs which the dealer had been accumulating for three or four months.Not having a smokehouse all his rubber was unsmoked.1 advised him to ship it to Kuching without delay.There are three instructors working in Lingga and two at Bakong.
Simanggang.
Not a single smokehouse has been built by the dealers here and thev all send their rubber to Kuching unsmoked The reason of this is,that there are so many buyers,than none of them can buy enough rubber to make a smokehouse pay.I told them that if every three or four shops build one one smokehouse it would certainly be to their advantage and I am confident that they are going to do so.On the other hand if the dealers do not put up smokehouses it will mean that those planters who can afford to erect them will get a better price for their cured sheets than would otherwise be the case.The rubber m the bazaar does not show a
very marked improvement yet.While I was at Simanggang I went up the Undup river as far as the house of Jingan.The Dyaks that I came in contact with were all interested in the idea of building their own smokehouses.
Saribas.
Of the three Saribas bazaars I visited,I am pleased to say that in none of them was 1 able to find a single sheet of really poor quality rubber.Some Dyaks at Betong who own smokehouses complained to me that they could get only six or seven cents per catty more for their cured rubber,than those who sell their rubber unsmoked.I explained to them that whereas some time ago those planters who had no smokehouses were very careless with their rubber,they are so no longer,but now sell their unsmoked rubber in a very good condition.
Kalaka.
All the gardens in Kalaka that are being tapped at present have been visited.Hundreds more will come into tapping every year as there are many young gardens.After the four smokehouses that are being erected now have been completed,there will be nine all told in Kalaka.Most of those
Dyaks,who have large gardens have promised to put up smokehouses.
Although the Dyaks here are just as keen as those in Saribas they are less careful with their rubber.I am finding it rather difficult to get them off a habit they have of sun-drying the rubber.The planters all know how to prepare their rubber and the poor quality rubber still to be found is due to negligence by it being left out in the sun too long,or by the sheets being packed on top of one another while they are still wet,thereby causing them to become mouldy.It is improving gradually and before long the rubber here will be just as good as that of Saribas.
While I was away from Saratok the Supervisor of Rubber Instructors went over to Roban and he reports that the rubber in the bazaar has greatly improved and in four days he sold nearly one hundred dollars worth of acetic acid.etc.During January $28580 worth of mangles,sieves and acetic acid was sold in Kalaka.
The Chinese have everywhere left off selling "Chop Daun" coagulant and now go in for acetic acid only.They have also greatly reduced the price of rubber mangles and many traders are selling them at $40 each This would never have been the case if it was not for the fact that we are selling mangles,etc.,at cost price
I shall be shifting my headquarters to Simanggang at the end of next week I am going to leave a couple of instructors behind to trace out bad rubber and re-instnict the places.It is sometimes very hard to get coolies and even when I can get them they are so slow that most of the time is spent in travelling.In a place like Batang Lupar it is necessary that I should have a launch,as the river is large and the gardens are,in most cases,very far apart.
Simanggang.
I arrived here from Kalaka on the 15th ultimo and on my way up spent a few days at Sebuyow and Lingga.Sebuyow rubber I found to be much better than when 1 was there the previous time.The rubber at Lingga too had improved though not as much as at Sebuyow.
All the gardens in Batang Lupar have now been visited.At present I am having the planters who still turn out poor quality rubber re-instructed I left four instructors in Kalaka for revisiting gardens and have just sent two more to Saribas I have been informed that since I left Saribas some new gardens have come into lapping and also that some more smokehouses have been erected.
120	THE SARAWAK GAZETTE,MAY 2,1927.
There are a few Dyaks here who are building smokehouses,while others are only waiting to see what the result will be when they too will do likewise.I he quantity of plain rubber sold by the smallholders is rapidly decreasing as many of them who have always been selling plain sheets of rubber are now buying mangles.Most of the Batang Lupar gardens are very small and consequently it is harder to get the people to build smokehouses than in the other two rivers.
Sadong.
I am glad to report that there are thirty smokehouses in Saribas now while several more are being erected.Many new gardens are continuously coming into tapping and consequently I had to leave two instructors behind.
The towkays at Saratok expressed themselves as highly pleased with the quality of the rubber that is at present being turned out by smallholders.Nine smokehouses have been erected in Kalaka.A number of houses have already bought building material and will put up smokehouses as soon as they have finished harvesting their padi.
Batang Lupar rubber and especially that of Lingga has improved satisfactorily and if only the planters had smokehouses it would be just as good as that of Saribas.
I have twelve instructors working in Sadong.The rubber here is not bad,as most of the planters cure their own rubber.
The rivers in the Second Division will want to be revisited now and again,as it will never do to leave them for any length of time.
Sibu.
The majority of Foochow towkays I have met up to the present appear quite keen to improve the quality of their rubber,and are quite prepared to follow out what I tell them They have not,however,sufficient control over their coolies to take any action if a cooly prefers his own way.With present prices a cooly makes anything from $35 to $45 per mensem and many.I regret to say,do take their own way.
I have erected a kongsi smokehouse at Bukit Lan and other individual Chinese are building smokehouses and agree to smoke their rubber daily.Others have promised to do so when they have seen the results to the pioneers.
Dyaks and Malays,being in most cases owners of the rubber,are easier to teach than the paid Chinese cooly,but they do not learn very quickly.Even they want to know very definitely if it is certain they will obtain more money by giving the little extra time that is required.
From an examination of the rubber in the bazaar when the Singapore boat is in port it is clear that the standard is going up,as the rubber hearing the Government "chop" is better than the unstencilled rubber.
My staff is now 20 Foochows and 7 Malays.

Bulan Puasa was ushered in with the usual salute of 7 guns on the evening of the 5th.
A fire broke out m Batu Kawa bazaar on the night of the 13th,starting in the dapor of one shop.The fire soon spread and destroyed the bazaar of 40 shops in a very short time.On receiving a report of the fire Mr.Ennion,with a party of police,proceeded to Batu Kawa to prevent any looting,spending the whole night on this duty.Members of the fire brigade also turned nut and were able to assist in preventing the fire from reaching the police station.I am very glad to report that Rantau Panjang Malays immediately turned out of their own accord to help and were able to save a quantity of movable property.
The Board of Visitors paid visits to the Gaol.General Hospital,Pauper and Leper Camps and were very pleased with what they saw.Only minor matters were brought to their notice.
Malays have had to be warned about the paving of exemption tax as very little was coming in.
Owing to the number of Dyaks coming to Kuching to work I have asked the Residents of the Second and Third Division if they would issue separate passes to each man instead of the communal pass.As these parties generally split up after a time,it is impossible to trace them or check their movements if their names are all entered on one pass.By my suggestion every Dyak should be able to produce his pass whenever called upon to do so.
The noise from unnecessary blowing of motor-horns was becoming a nuisance along Rock Road,so the Commissioner of Police was asked to lay a trap.26 drivers were reported of whom 6 were had up in Court and fined.The nuisance has considerably abated.
The O.K.of Bungoh complained that Katok,a Malay in the employ of Mijnheer L.H.Krol of the N.I.Geological Dept.,arrived at their village and damaged some sacred stones,pieces of which ho took away to Kuching.They attempted to prevent him but he threatened them with the police.Katok has been sent for.

121;
I went to Sadong on 6th by the Lucile to settle several outstanding cases,returning again on the 8th.I also went to Ban on the 19th to hear the case in which Liew Miaw was to be tried for the attempted murder of Liew Shot and P.C.Jaya Singh and resisting arrest by armed means.
The trip both ways was accomplished by car on the same day.The flat piece of road this side of Batu Killing was in a very had state.It is only a short stretch,which I think could be drained and raised.
Mr.Le Sueur visited Santubong to look into complaints that Haji Ahmad had ordered the cutting down of ail coconut trees in the kampong. This was found not to be correct.
Dyaks from Kampong Saga,an offshoot of Singghi,complained that the Sungei Moyan Rubber Estate were extending and encroaching on their land.The spot was visited and the matter settled to the satisfaction of both sides.
The Moyan Malays and Dyaks still continue to dispute over land for the purposes of planting rubber.It is proposed to put them into reserves, when it is hoped that in time they will all be satisfied.
Mr.Miller-Hallet visited Sambir and the upper part of the Samarahan with the intention of seeing whether it was possible to connect the Samarahan river with the Eusingnei,a tributary of the Sadong. by means a ditch.The jungle was found to be all swamp owing to the heavy rains and so he had to return without accomplishing anything.
In order to open up the land in the Sambir and Moyan districts,it is proposed to extend the existing drain to the "ulus" of the Nonok and Sampun rivers and eventually on to the Sadong river and miles inland from this drain to dig another one of 15 feet breadth,joining up the Sadong and Samarahan rivers.The land in between this area to be divided into 20-acre lots.The cost of this scheme.I estimate to be about $45,000 and it will take the best part of two years to complete. The expenditure will be recovered partially from land rents Mr.Miller-Hallet will be in charge of this work and hopes to start next month,when the weather should be more favourable.
Land Office.The following grant,leases,squatter licences and occupation tickets were issued during
the month:-
1	Grant for rubber
2	Leases for coconuts
3	Squatter licences for coconuts and rubber

Sibu.
January,1927.
Court The fourteen upriver Dyaks Under arrest in connection with the double murder at S.Aup were on trial on the 5th and 7th of the month.Before the conclusion of the defence the assessors unanimously pronounced all the defendants not guilty and they were discharged.The head of the house near the scene of the murder,Agul,was ordered to place the sum of $560 as security,pending further inquiries.
A civil claim against a Singapore firm for the sum of $25,000 was adjourned for evidence from Singapore.
At Rejang the adopted son of a shopkeeper was sentence to 2 years' R.I.for theft of opium and a long outstanding appeal from the decision of the District Court could not be heard,the defendant being absent in Singapore.
General,I was at Sibu nutil the 7th,when I left for Rejang.On the following day I left Rejang for Matu accompanied by the District Officer of Lower Rejang.It was impossible to reach Matu that evening so we spent the night at Daro,arriving at Matu the following noon.
The Tua Kampong called on me and asked to be allowed a monthly allowance to defray expenses incidental to their position.I promised to consider the matter.
I returned to Rejang on the 2nd inst.,leaving the following day for Kuching by H.H.M.Y.Maimunah.I Arrived at Sibu again on the 30th inst.
Messrs.Andreini,P.M.Adams and J.C.Swayne returned to their districts on the 3rd,5tn and 7th respectively.
Arrangements were made with the head Foochows to limit the number of immigrants dining the year.These arrangements have not proved satisfactory owing to lack of proper organization on the part of the Foochow Agent in Singapore.
Haji Sahak,for many years Tua Kampong of Kampong Ilar.Sibu,was allowed to retire,Haji Mamat taking his place.

The scheme to acquire laud on the angle between Telephone Road and the race-course was abandoned and about 12 acres of land facing the
race-course and the Green Road were purchased at a cost of $3,450.This land,together with the plot originally owned by Government,will accommodate jail and offices together with barracks and quarters for clerks.The land so acquired is considerably higher than that on Telepnone Road.All plots are planted up with rubber and fruits and were purchased from Malays.A certain amount of unoccupied land adjacent to these plots will also be available
Mr.G.S.Grilfifths,Supt.of Lands,arrived at Sibu from Kuching on the30tn instant to inquire into the land question in this Division.
A dispute between Penghulus Langgong and Enggong as to their respective rights to collect tax and settle disputes in five houses was settled at Kanowit by my instructions,the houses remaining under the jurisdiction of the former Penghulu.
On the 11th a deputation from Kampong Nyabor waited on me with regard to the alleged conduct of Tua Kampong Lebi Salleh.Their complaints were without foundation or sense.More than 40 pilgrims left Sibu during the month for Mecca and Medina.These included Tuanku Ali of the Education Department,Tuanku Drahman of Baram and Tuanku Seman a well-known Sibu man.
Mohamed Seh,a prominent Sibu trader,died on the 12th and Police Sergeant-Major Salleh on the next day.
During the month,accompanied by the Revd.J.M.Hoover,I visited some schools in the Foochow Colony.The method of teaching Malay is far from good and the teachers themselves appear to be ignorant of the correct pronunciation and spelling of the words.The need of a standardized Malay reader for Chinese schools is obvious.
The Resident left for Rejang on 17th and returned on the 30th,having visited Kuching also.
Immigration has started again and 110 Foochows arrived during the month.Many others,to the number of about 200,arrived too but most of these were Foochows returning to Sarawak again.

The total strength of the force at the end of the month was 90,consisting of 27 Malays,21 Dyaks, 11 Melanoes,2 Tanjongs,7 Sepoys,4 Pathans,1 Punjab,14 Sikhs,Bagat,1 Gurkha,and one Foochow Detective.
Prison.Two Dyaks and two Foochows were imprisoned during the month,and two Foochows, one Teochew,one Hokkien and one Tamil were discharged.
The average daily number of prisoners was 36.9 and the number still in prison at the end of the month was 47,consisting of 15 Foochows,5 Javanese,8 Dyaks,3 Hokkiens,4 Malays,3 Teochews,3 Henghuas,1 Melano,3 Khehs,1 Honan,and 1 Tamil.
As mentioned under Police Court in this report prisoners Chee Hee Kiang and Ting Wang Chaw were sentenced on the 10th inst.to 2 months' extra imprisonment,4 days' fatigue and irons for attempt- ing to escape on the 25th December.Also,as mentioned above,prisoners Chee Hee Kiang,Ngo Mee Cheong and Sia Hok Wong were sentenced on the 10th inst.to 6 months' extra imprisonment,24 strokes with the rattan and irons for escaping from gaol on the 2nd.The Divisional Medical Officer allowed only 18 strokes to be inflicted on each man.

The Asst.Superintendent Rubber Exports.Mr. W.Lowry,reports:-
The majority of Foochow towkays I have met up to the present appear quite keen to improve the quality of their rubber,and are quite prepared to follow out what 1 tell them.They have not,however, sufficient control over their cpolies to take any action if a cooly prefers his own way.With present prices a coolv makes anything from $35 to $45 per mensem and many,I regret to say,do take their own way.
I have erected a " kongsi " smokehouse at Bulit Lan and other individual Chinese are building smokehouses and agree to smoke their rubber daily. Others have promised to do so when they have seen the results to the pioneers.
Dyaks and Malays,being in most cases owners of the rubber,are easier to teach than the old Chinese cooly,but they do not learn very quickly. Even they want to know definitely if it is certain they will obtain more money by giving the little extra time that is required.
From an examination of the rubber in the bazaar when the Singapore boat is in port it is clear that the standard is going up,as the rubber bearing the Government " chop " is better than the unstencilled rubber.
My staff is now 20 Foochows and 7 Malays.
Lower Rejang.
The District Officer of Lower Rejang,Mr.J.C Swayne,reports:-
I returned from Sibu on the 7th.On the following day a wireless message was received from Matu,reporting an outbreak of chicken-pox.The dresser went there the same day and confirmed this, too further cases were found at the end of the

The Acting District Officer of Kapit,Mr,E.V.Andreini,reports: -
General.The early part of the month was spent visiting the Mujong and side streams.Apart from a complaint against Penghulu Ugak by a few of his followers nothing of importance occurred.The Penghulu was found to have been settling cases the without the presence of one of the contending parties.I severely reprimanded him and informed him should this occur again I should have him brought before you.With the exception of three houses all the Dyaks here are now in houses of 10 doors or more accessible for Govern- ment to visit.Abang Abdulgapor,Native Officer,visited the Katibas and Sut,being accompanied to the former river by the Native Officer,Song.
Later in the month I spent a few days in the Song District and visited all the houses below Song as far as the Ngmah and Mlepis and Sbatu above Song.The outboard motor was of great assistance and enabled me to save much time and labour.
Land.Song District.The preceding few months having been spent collecting scattered houses and
forming villages of 10 doors or more a start was made to allot reserves for the villages to plant rubber and other cultures and boundary marks were placed and Dyaks informed that they could not plant rubber or other cultures except in these reserves.This has become necessary owing to constant complaints and to avoid litigation.
Agriculture.Padi crop promises very well.Coffee and limes were amongst cultures noted in the Mujong,whilst below Song,coffee and cotton is being planted by Dyaks.There have been demands from Dyaks for all sorts of plants and the Director of Agriculture is going to try and send seeds and plants for them to try.

Land.Mr.Griffiths visited the district from 9th to 16th and investigated the local land policy and collected much data.He expressed satisfaction on the methods adopted to enforce the land order,which he found were almost identical with those ruling at Sibu.
It was most fortunate that Mr.Griffiths was able to take over the district and thus prevent the probability of the local policy falling into disuse.
Clerical.Owing to Spurah proving untrustworthy Muman look over the main cash books at Oya.The terms offered in the new scale of pay vide Notification LX,1927,were explained to the clerks,but one or two points which appear to be uncertain need to be interpreted before the clerks can decide whether or not to join under the new scale.

According to instructions I took over the charge of this district from Mr.P.M.Adams on 21st.At my request Mr.Adams suspended the clerk Spurah and forbade him to enter the offices as from 20th.I asked Mr.Adams to take this step as I was unwilling to accept responsibility for this clerk's presence in the offices,with access to books and correspondence,taking into account his own circumstances and the fact that I myself am a learner.
Court.Only one case of any importance was settled,viz.,Liang Chuan vs.Kim (f.),the former claiming custody of a child.The case bore on one heard years ago by Mr.Swayne.Custody of the child was awarded to Kim (f.),but it is understood that,an appeal is pending.

P.W.D.-Two prison gangs were employed continuously,one on levelling part of the new bungalow site on the peninsula,and the other,composed of six men,on general upkeep including minor repairs to ditches,roads and bridges in the bazaar.
Work on the new bungalow on the peninsula was practically at a standstill owing,I am informed,to shortage of timber.
The exteriors of five clerks' houses were scraped of whitewash and oiled.This has considerably improved their appearance and probably their durability.This work was still in progress at the end of the month.
Special sanction having been obtained for an extension for the police office,this was put in hand and satisfactory progress was made.
The lighthouse keepers' quarters at T.Lobang were practically rebuilt.Some minor repairs were effected on the police barracks.
Work was started on a new parcel strong room in the post office,and at the same time a few interior alterations were also undertaken in that building.
A pergola was erected between the new bungalow and No.5 across river,and some repairs were effected on the Brighton bungalow handed over by Messrs.The Sarawak Oilfields,Ltd.,in replacement of the old treasury bungalow.
Work was started on extensive repairs and alterations to the bazaar police station.
Complaints were received from the bazaar during the month that there was no water coming through the pipes.This was after only seven days' drought.Owing to the fact of there being no seive on the reservoir end of the pipe it is highly probable that the pipe is temporarily choked in many places.It has been suggested that the present plant be thoroughly overhauled and cleaned and a cheap filter system of rubble and sand be instituted; but this may require expert opinion from Kuching.
General.- Mr.Horton's bungalow having no water laid on,ran short during several days,which necessitated the prisoners taking over supplies in tins.
Early in the month it was reported from Suai that forty Kapuas Dyaks were working jelutong between Labang and Suai.The matter was reported by wireless to Bintulu and it was ascertained that they were not Kapuas Dyaks and that they were in no way violating regulations.
Various applicants for driving licences were tested.
A serious boating accident occurred on the 11th resulting in one Chinese being drowned.It appears that a Chinese fishing boat capsized off the bar and the occupants were in the water,holding on to wreckage,for over half an hour.
I regret to report the death on the 13th from apoplexy of Mr.A.Foien who had been working in the company as a driller for some twelve years.The interment took place in St.Columba's Cemetery on the 14th.the Rev.Synott officiating.
The 24th,being the anniversary of Her Highness the Ranee's birthday,the offices were closed and the flagstaff dressed.

I left on the 28th for Long Palai together with Mr.Allman.
Rainfall for the month was 2.34 inches.
Prison and Public Works.-The prison gang averaging 19 men were employed on general upkeep work.The carpenter was employed on Fort altera- tion and repairing the long boat which has been in constant use for several months past,driven by an outboard motor.
