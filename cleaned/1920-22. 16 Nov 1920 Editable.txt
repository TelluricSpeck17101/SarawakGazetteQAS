TUESDAY. NOVEMBER 16, 1920.
ARMISTICE DAY.
At 11 a.m. on Armistice Day. November 11th. a gun was tired from the Fort, all flags were put at half-mast, and a two minute silence was observed in memory of the glorious dead who fell in the Great War, the conclusion of the silence being marked by the Last Post, which was placed by the buglers of the Rangers Band. A telegram had previously been received from the British Government expressing the hope that as far as possible throughout the Empire there should be a two minute silence and complete suspension of normal business at 11 a.m. on Armistice Day, November 11th.
NOTES.
(November.)
IN April 1919 His Highness the Rajah intimated the desire of the Government of Sarawak to contribute $5,000 annually for six years to His Majesty's Government, and two instalments of this sum have been acknowledged by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.
The contributions received from Sarawak together with offers from Bermuda, Ceylon, the Gold Coast, Falkland Islands, the Straits Settlements and Jamaica, will now be paid over to the National Debt Commissioners to be used by them in the cancellation of War Debt.
A limited number of copies of a New Novel by Sylvia Brett, privately published, will be received shortly. Those who require copies should apply at once to Captain Gifford, Kuching.
$4 postage free.

Memorial Fund.
19th. October, 1920.
The Editor,
Sarawak Gazette.
SIR.
The subscriptions for the erection of a suitable
Memorial to His Highness the late Rajah are still
coming in but very slowly and the total is not what it should be. I understand that the fund is to be used for the endowment of a Pauper Hospital and Leper Camp while subscribers may earmark their subscriptions for a special Memorial if they wish to do so.
It would be interesting to hear when the subscriptions lists are to be closed, how much it is expected to realise, what sum is to be allocated to the Pauper Hospital and Leper Camp and what to a special Memorial, and of what that Memorial is to consist.
Were a Memorial Hall or some similar scheme the object of the Fund a much larger sum would be subscribed, the unsuitability and consequent unpopularity of the original suggestion being responsible for the very small result to date, numerous subscriptions
being witheld in that account.
I am, Sir,
Yours faithfully,
INTERESTED. UPPER SARAWAK.
BAU AND PAKU.
October.
Taking into consideration the low price of rubber and pepper and the high cost of living it would not be surprising if petty thefts and other crimes were on the increase. At present, however, there is no sign of this.
One Chinese was sentenced for house breaking. A recently released prisoner was convicted of theft. This being his fourth conviction for similar offences, he received a long sentence.
Three Tondong Chinese coolies were convicted of attempting to make off with the ferry boat at night. One of the men resisted arrest with a weapon while another used a heavy stick and got away, but was arrested in Tondong bazaar two nights Inter. These men received exemplary sentences.
On the 6th. instance no fewer than six Javanese were arrested and detained. Two were arrested by police in Bau bazaar, two were detained by the Tua Kampong of Grogo, while one was taken in the coolie lines at Puak.
Of these men, three proved to have absconded from Sungei Tengah, while the other three were sent to Kuching, it being practically certain that they came from the Samarahan Rubber Estate.
Two Chinese hawkers were fined for living in Dayak houses contrary to regulations. One of these men was in possession of a false daching and was also fined for this offence.
On the 6th. instant a Bidi Chinese reported that his house was burned down on the previous evening during his absence. The house was quite close to the Krokong and Suba road, and it seems probable that some passerby deliberately set a light to the building.
A very severe thunderstorm on the afternoon of the 5th. burnt out five fuses in the Telephone Central, and also damaged the electrical plant at the Works. The damage done at the Works affected the whole telephone system, which was rendered useless until the following evening.
The Seniawan Chinese held a jamboree on the 5th. and 6th. instants with a view to propitiating a crocodile which has been a nuisance there for some months. This beast first attacked a Chinese who was bathing, and later on a policeman. In both cases the men got away more or less severely bitten

and clawed. The idea of the jamboree was, so I understand, to induce the crocodile to retire to Samarahan, front which place it was supposed to have come to Siniawan. it is not certain whether this object was achieved, but there have been no further attacks made on Chinese.
The contractor responsible for the up-keep of the Jambusan road was dismissed as the road was in a disgraceful state. The prison gang has now put the road in good order. Pipes nave been laid down in place of the numerous small bilian culverts, and the ditches opened up. For the time being the road can lie taken over by a small gang of prisoners.
Three men have been employed at Paku demolishing part of the old police barracks there. The Siniawan police have moved into a house in the bazaar until the barracks there have been rebuilt. A good deal of the necessary timber is now ready at Siniawan.
The ferrymans house at Selalang has been repaired by contract, but the work was so badly done that the contractor has been ordered to do it again. Material is ready for rebuilding the Tondong ferrymans house.

SADONG. September.
P. C.S Awang Aman and Abang Moh returned from Balai Karangan in H. M. N. I. on the 5th. bringing into Custody, Usen. Mai (f). Baki and Umar who were wanted by the Sarawak Government, on a charge of murder, and whom the Dutch Authorities, had kindly had arrested, and escorted to that place. I took these people to Kuching on the 7th. returning on the 11th.
Court work has been light this month, people being busy on their farms.
There is a shortage of local rice, and many people have applied to borrow or buy Government padi. As soon as the restriction on export of local padi and rice was removed, numbers sold their meagre stocks at once: no doubt hoping to be able to buy or borrow from Government enough to tide them over until the next harvest, and cheaper than for what they sold their own padi. Investigations have been made and to those people who have sold their padi, no assistance at all will be given. To others in dire need a certain amount of padi will be lent.
These people are absolutely hopeless, and it is only by making it as difficult as possible for them, during times such as these, that they will ever learn, or make any effort to fend for themselves.
The Alice Lorraine arrived from Sibu on the 19th., with passenger Mr. Archer, en route for Kuching. She sailed again the same night.
Seventeen S'bangan Malays were mulcted the sum of $3 each for contempt concerning Forest Regulations.
Contempt or laziness, is most common in the outstations of this district, and seems very hard to cure.
H. H. the Rajah's birthday falling on Sunday the 26th. a holiday was observed on the following day.
Only five steamers and six schooners entered and cleared the port, during the month.

October.
The Resident, Mr. A. B. Ward arrived on the 4th. by Alice Lorraine, bringing the persons suspected of
the murder of one Ong Cheng: referred to in previous reports; and they were tried here on the 5th.
A jury with Mr. E. H. Haldane of Messrs. the Sarawak Rubber Estates, as foreman, and comprised of Chinese, Malays and Dayaks, was empanelled, and the verdict returned was Mai (f) not guilty, Baki and Umar guilty of murder. Usen the principal person concerned, and the leader, was unable to be tried, as he was lying in Kuching ill of pneumonia, from which he succumbed.
The prisoners were taken back to Kuching to have sentence pronounced.
The Resident returned to Kuching on the following day.
Having been granted leave I left by boat for Si-, manggang on the 9th. arriving there on the 10th. I accompanied Mr. J. A. H. Hardie on his visit to the Saribas, and took passage by Alice Lorraine at Pusa to Kuching, returning to Sadong by same vessel on the 23rd.
The high tides of the 29th. and 30th, caused the station to be inundated, and left behind a thick layer of slimy mud.
The s. s. Gladys arrived on the 31st. en route for Singapore. Passengers by her were Mr. Ed. Parnell for Singapore, and Mr. P. C. Cobbold for Sadong.
Trade is very bud here at present, and very little jelutong or getah riau leaves are being worked.
Reports from the padi farms are excellent, and a considerably larger area has been planted up this year. People at Jaie and S'bangan whose last crop failed, and who planted again immediately, should be harvesting in two months time.
Five steamers and six schooners entered and cleared the port during the mouth.

SEMANGGANG.
September.
I returned to Lingga from Kuching on the 15th. by s. l. Young Harry. After hearing a few cases there I returned here the following afternoon.
Mr. W. F. Dick reported that four convicts -Boon Sen, Chai Tun, Lee Tai-Siew and Kho Ah Seng alias Ah Nyan, had escaped from the working gang on the 1st., and that the two first named, who were serving sentences of ten years for gang robbery at Batu Kawa, were killed in showing armed resistence the same evening. Kho Ah Seng was recaptured at Tawang down-river on the 3rd . and Lee Tai Siew in Saribas on the 5th. I have forwarded Mr. Dick's report on his enquiry into this matter to the Committee of Administration under separate cover.
Mr. Dick also reported that Voon Kam, another of the long sentence prisoners, died of dysentery on the 11th.
J. M. Lungang, Court Writer of Lubok Antu, was accidentally drowned while bathing in the river there on the 23rd. The body was brought down here and buried in the S. P.G. Cemetery at Sabu on the 25th, the Rev. W. Linton officiating.
Mr. Dick proceeded to Lubok Antu on the 26th., with Gomes Suboh to be placed there again temporarily as Court Writer. Mr. Dick returned here on the 26th., having found the cash which had been taken charge of by the Native Officer, Abang Zin. correct. I have reported on some items in the late Writer's accounts direct to the Treasurer. In view of a statement made by Penghulu Ringgit to Mr. Dick, I had occasion to address the Controleur of Smitau
251 THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, NOVEMBER 16, 1920.
regarding certain threats made by Bantin on returning to Netherlands Territory after the peace-making before His Highness the Rajah here in August, and a copy of my letter has been forwarded to the Committee of Administration. Bantin apparently considers himself, though a leader of the Ulu Ai in the former raids on the Skrangs. Layers and Lemanaks, as unaffected by the peaceful understanding arrived at between these Sarawak tribes from the fact that he now lives m Netherlands India Territory, to whose protection he had to flee from attacks directed at him by Sarawak Government Forces. Bantin himself is too old now to take part in such forays, but his sons are known to have been concerned in raids in the Rejang. I have no doubt the Netherlands Authorities will effectively inculcate on Bantin the inadvisability of again disturbing the peace.
The 26th., being Sunday, the following day was observed as a general holiday in honour of His Highness the Rajahs birthday.
The Government pony Freda, known to all stationed here for many years past, died of old age that morning.
P. Sgt. Samsudin, and P. Corpl. Tairudin were allowed to retire on pension by permission of His Highness the Rajah at the beginning of the month. The former had been 36 years, and the latter 32, in the 2nd. Division Police Force.
Court.Land disputes continued to occupy most of the time of the Courts ; and, until there is a settled land policy for the tenure of Dayak farming lands, these are bound to recur. But it is open to question whether the introduction of any such system would not cause more trouble in its application than it would save, unless of course a sufficient, and efficient, staff were employed for its supervision.
Several cases of petty theft were disposed of and minor sentences imposed. It is distinctly possible to trace one effect of the high cost of living by reference to the local Prison books. Whereas a lew years back the gang used to average 25 men. a number of whom were serving sentences for contempt of Court or in default of fines or debts, now there are some 60 in gaol, of whom only 8 are imprisoned for such minor offences.
Among more serious cases during the mouth were : Chai Seng sentenced to 6 months for theft from a hut; Sulong a Chinese-Dayak lad of not more than 10 years, and reported to be an opium smoker, remanded indefinitely until he shows distinct signs of reformation. He was proved the culprit in a series of petty thefts which had been reported for some time in Saratok bazaar. Bong Nam sentenced to one year for theft of pepper at Nanga Lemanak. and Chong Mio and Chai Kap to 6 months for aiding and abetting him. Bong Phow, a Hylam, 3 months for vagrancy and living in Dayak houses at Stumbin. where he was apparently trying to initiate the Dayaks into the mysteries of the Chinese language. Belun, a Krian Dayak, was sentenced to 5 years for rape on a child, I have reported on this case under separate cover to the Resident of the 1st. Division. Lee Phu Tho (f). Yew Ah Bek of Saratok were, according to the Chinese Court Regulations, fined $100 each, and the former ordered to refund $100 dowry to the petitioner Bun Thio her husband. Garit, the Skrang Dayak, remanded for the attempted murder of his wife and child, as mentioned in my reports for April and July, was sent to the Supreme Court for trial, and later sentenced to 5 years imprisonment.

Court.Only a few minor cases were settled as I was up-river collecting pupu during the latter half of the month.
Ribai was fined $22.14 for sarak. Bareng and Udin were lined $5 each ; and also forfeited the 3 small blukos jelutong which they had worked before taking out permits.
P. H. D.Prisoners have been kept busy on the roads and ornamental grounds.
Days" Road from Kampong Bakong. through the jungle, to the sea-shore has been cleared, as it was impassable.
The cattle ground also has been again thoroughly cleared, green food hitherto having been practically a minus quantity owing to the subsisting undergrowth.
Food Control- 1,026 gantangs were sold ex-Govt. Rice Store, a considerable increase over the previous month.
A good deal of Dayak rice has been procured by the various traders, and is of excellent quality.
The Dayaks are not at all willing to sell, and will only part with their rice or padi in exchange for various necessities.
They still feel the result of the failure of the 1918 crop, and expect to have to go on short rations before next harvest, which promises to be a good one, should nothing untoward occur, as they are plaining this year on a very large scale.
There have been several complaints lately, however, regarding the excessive amount of grit in the. imported rice.

I left for the Ulu on the 13th., and did not return until the end of the month.
While there, a few minor cases were settled.
In view of the increasing number of individuals working timber, I reserved 3 small rivers for tip use of Dayaks working bilian, etc., for Government only.

In the Court of Requests, Ah Kui was ordered to pay various claimants, debts incurred by him and Wee Ah Hong in Oya, amounting to $1,529.63. They have both been returned to Sibu, where they are further implicated, accused of swindling. Ah Kuis request to appeal was granted.
P. W. D. Prisoners have been engaged in re-barrelling kampong Oya road, repairing light-house road, rebuilding steps to kampong landing stage, and general work on roads and ornamental grounds, also at Dalat.
Materials, both bilian and soft wood, for the new police barracks are arriving slowly.
The bilian attaps, ordered from Tatau, are ready and awaiting shipment thence.
Food Control. 746 gantangs were sold during the month ex-Govt. rice store The three chief Towkays in Dalat, have accepted 100 bags rice each, and been permitted to sell it at the fixed rate.
Hitherto rice has only been sold from the Oya store, owing to the small clerical staff and lack of storing accommodation at Dalat. This amount, together with a supply already stored at Oya, should hist over the landas.
There have again been large discrepancies in the weights received compared with those shipped from Kuching.
During the month were exported :
... 168 koyans
Raw Sago
10 schooners entered. 7 schooners cleared.
General.I left for Mukah on the 1st., and spent the weekend there. Mr. Vincent B. Down passed through e.n route to Sibu on the 6th. On the same date, Sergt. Dullah of the local police returned to duty, having been laid up for a month.
On the 19th., Metamin Tua Kampong, Medong. after a rapid decline, died from consumption. Tirah will in all probability lie accepted as his successor.
Lungang. who had been complaining of ill-health was released on the 28th. but also died of consumption later.
Spurah, assistant clerk at Oya, has been transferred temporarily to Dalat vice V. Billy who will lie instructed in duties at Oya.
