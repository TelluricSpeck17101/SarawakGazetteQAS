NOTES.
October.
The following account of Dr. Hoses visit to the Barams district has been contributed by an eye witness.
On September 26th. Dr. Charles Hose paid a visit to the Baram District where he was for so long Resident.
He was greeted on the landing stage by the people in large numbers amidst the letting off of crackers and cheers and then went up to the fort where he made a short speech saying how pleased he was to be able to come back and see all his old friends.
After lunch at the fort, Dr. Hose with his wife and two children went up-river and stayed the night with the Kenyahs at Long Pasar where he was not allowed to sleep but had to sit up all night telling them stories of the days of Tama Bulan, etc. From there the party went up to Long Palai and rowed in a long boat a little way and after a bathe from the stones started back for the fort at Claudetown collecting various people en route. By the time Claudetown was reached at 6 p.m. the small company's launch was crowded and a long line of boats towed behind. At Claudetown the people had prepared a big feast and had killed a cow, and the Court house in the fort was decorated very nicely with dowers and evergreens all round and hung with flags with Welcome to Dr. Hose " in English, Malay and Chinese.
Al least 300 people were present and speeches were made in English, in Malay by the Datu Sheriff Hamid, Sergeant Anchi (the oldest inhabitant) Tuanku Draham, in Kenyah by Buling of Long Pasar, in Long Kiput by Sumbang of Long Tutoh, in Dayak by Penghulu Lanting, welcoming Dr. Hose and his wife and children and wishing them long life, etc.
Dr. Hose replying in Malay said how pleased he was to come, and after reminding them of the old days of trouble, how glad he was to find the people now so happy and contented; he said that wherever he was, he always thought of the happy times he had at

Baram in fact there was not a place like it in his opinion and he had seen many Lands.
The business of eating then took up the people for an hour or so after which there was dancing in Malay, Chinese and up-river and Dayak fashion and a most enjoyable evening finished at 1 A. M. by the Dr. being escorted back to the house where he was staying and the company breaking up. The next morning a good many people were on the wharf at 7 A. M. to say good-bye but several of the older ones did not come as one of them said he was afraid of breaking down and weeping which would be undignified.
Dr. Hose went away with the good wishes of the people who are grateful for all he did for them in the days gone by, and appreciate his coming back to see them again; this visit will long be remembered and they wish him the best of health long life and happiness at home.

Sad Drowning Fatality.
AT SEA VIEW.
At about four o'clock yesterday afternoon a sad drowning fatality occurred at the Sea View Hotel. At the time mentioned a child whose parents reside at the hotel while walking along the sea wall fell in. The screams of the youngster's attendant soon brought assistance and Captain Kearon, late chief officer of the Kuching, who was just preparing to enter the water sprang to the boys assistance. The tide which was high at the time swept both out and the horrified spectators which had gathered soon saw that both were in difficulties. One of the bandsmen of the hotel secured a lifebuoy and rescued the child and later the body of the Captain was brought ashore. Artificial means of respiration were tried for about an hour but without avail. It is surmised that Captain was seized with cramp.
An inquiry will probably be opened this morning, and the funeral is to take place this afternoon -( Free Press. )
It is rumoured that Holt's are now building ships which will make non-stop runs from Liverpool to Singapore in eighteen days.(F. P.)
On the last trip of the s. s. Rajah of Sarawak from Singapore to Fremantle the chief officer, Francis D. Lewis, after walking off the vessel on to the wharf collapsed and died before he could be removed to the hospital. Heart failure the cause.(F. P.)

SIR,
Re letters to you in your last issue from Curious" and "Billiards.
If the competition was properly arranged before hand, there would lie no argument.
Being a regular reader of your valuable paper I wonder if there are any poker or billiard players (or rules) in Sarawak.
It leads one to feel that it is hardly safe to play either poker or billiards in Kuching unless the rules are definitely set down in writing before the commencement of the game.
Yours faithfully,
B. B. B.
UPPER SARAWAK
BAU AND PAKU.
September.
There has been very little Court work during the month, probably on account of Chinese and others being busy on their padi farms.
Two Chinese were convicted of stealing pigs, and were sentenced to a term of imprisonment. As the two pigs stolen were alive and weighed nearly three piculs it is certain that others were involved, but although three other men were arrested, no proof could be obtained of their complicity.
Ina ease of defamation of character two of the police were fined and sent back to headquarters.
On the morning of the 9th. a most determined attempt was made to burn down one of the blocks of new Police Barracks. The fire had been smouldering for some time when it was discovered. It had started on the back verandah outside the corporal's room. Beyond the destruction of a couple of beams and a few planks no damage was done. Although

I left for Kalaka on the 22nd. by the s. I. Mermaid, accompanied by Abang Haji Buasan, reaching Sebuyow the same evening. Abang Haji Buasan settled some outstanding Native Court cases the next morning before we left for Kabong, which was reached under five hours. We went on to Saratok on the 24th., and Court was held there that afternoon and the following day.
Having fever and dysentery. I left for Kuching by s. l. Mermaid the same evening to obtain medical advice, and was still away from the Division at the end of the month.
Court.With the exception of a number of cases concerning farming lands in the Balau, Skrang, and Saribas districts, there was comparatively little litigation. Kho Ah Seng, 'alias Ah Nyan was sentenced to six months for breaking into a garden hut at Sabu and stealing property left there. Suga, ulu Krian Dayak, was heavily fined for felling another Dayaks old para rubber trees which came within his boundary in a dispute over farming laud ; and Munah (f), Sebuyow Dayak was fined 1 picul in connection with the case mentioned in the April report.
Certain changes were made in the Clerical Staff during the mouth ; Sim Chin Kaw. Court Writer of Kalaka, and Lagan, Court Writer of Saribas, exchanging stations; Gomes, Court Writer of Lubok Antu, being brought down here, and Lungang sent there in his place.
Saribas --- Sixteen Malay houses in the PUSA Kam- pong were destroyed by fire on the 31st.
Kalaka -The houses of Haji Kebok and Tukang Usop, wealthy Kabong Malays, were burnt down during the night of the 19th. Fortunately there was no wind at the time, but the Native Officer's house, and others close by, narrowly escaped destruction The loss incurred is estimated at not less than $3,000.
A Roban Chinaman by name Ah Seng was drowned on the 20th. while returning from the bazaar in a small boat. His body was recovered the following day at Nanga Niah.
Trade Returns.All restrictions having been taken off the sale and export of native padi and rice throughout the Division on the 15th., traders since have been shipping as much as possible to Kuching, and the local price of padi has. in accordance, risen from $1 a pasu to over $2, and for rice from 40 cents a gantang to over $1.
The pepper crop is being largely held up in the hope of better prices being fetched later Working of jelutong has largely ceased temporarily, all natives being busily employed clearing and burning off their farms.
The following are the returns for the Division:
Imports. Exports.

SIBU.
August.
Court.There were only one or two cases of any importance. Lisang and Bun, two Dayaks who murdered Letan during the Gaat expedition 3 years ago were, by order of His Highness, fined and ordered to pay pati nyawa to the relations of deceased.
Nuing and Jabat who murdered three Chinese below Kanowit in May of last year and who have been hiding in the jungle ever since, surrendered at Sibu,
there are strong suspicions locally who is responsible for this, no proof can be obtained.
The Native Officer has been continually complaining that traders have been staying at Jagoi with the Dayaks contrary to orders, but on enquiries being made there seems to lie no foundation for this statement.
Burning was finished early in the month, and the padi was showing up well at the end of the month.
Complaints having been received from the Netherlands Indies Authorities of arms and ammunition being taken across the border, police were despatched to warn all the heads of the Dayaks to detain all persons attempting to cross the border without passes. I have received no detailed complaint, nor have any particular persons been mentioned.
I left lor Kuching on the 11th. instant and was absent there on duty until the 21st.
Mr. J. B. Archer visited the station from the 21st. to the 29th,
The Offices were closed on the 27th., His Highness the Rajahs birthday being observed on that day.
Prisoners, a small gang only, have been employed on roads and general tip-keep work.
H. L. OWEN.
District Officer.
SIMANGGANG.
His Highness the Rajah, accompanied by Captain W. R. B. Gifford with Mr. E. Parnell and Mr P. H. Hayward, arrived at Lingga on the 2nd. by H. H. S. Y. Zahora and proceeded here next morning by s. l. Mermaid.
The peace-making between the Ulu Ais and Skrang, Layer and Lemanak Dayaks took place on the padang before His Highness on the following day. All the Penghulus of the 2nd. Division and Ulu Ai chiefs were present at this ceremony ; also Bantin, and other Dayak headmen from Netherlands India.
The Annual Regatta and Sports occupied the two following days; and, on the 7th., a tuba fishing was held at Nanga Skrang.
His Highness was pleased to sanction the Dayak custom of beselam ai being reverted to in Dayak cases where an oath is considered necessary for a decision, after permission to order same has been obtained by the penghulu hearing the case from the Officer-in-charge, but such permission only to be given when every other settlement fails.
His Highness was also pleased to grant each pen- ghulu a Government flag, dachin, pasu and gantang measures; and to each Native Officer a flag. By order of His Highness, the Dayak Penghulus are to be put on graduated pay, according to the extent of their responsibilities, without further commission on tax or tines.
The Native Officers, Penghulus, and principal Natives and Chinese were seen by His Highness, but nothing of importance was brought forward except that a number of Simanggang towkays asked for the restrictions against the export of padi and rice from the 2nd. Division should be maintained, being concerned about the prospect of difficulties with the pepper planters should it he found necessary to import high-priced foreign rice later in the year in addition to the high cost of other necessary commodities and the comparatively low price of pepper. They were informed that the policy had been settled by the Food Control for the benefit of the majority, and that it was impracticable to have local restrictions in various districts.
His Highness and party returned to Kuching on the 9th
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, OCTREE 16, 1920.
Nyanggow having been to Kuching without permission and obtained an understanding from His Highness that only fines would be imposed if they surrendered.
Fines were consequently imposed by this Court but the two men were sent down to Kuching where they were further ordered to pay pati nyawa to the relations. I understand the Chinese community refuse to accept this decision of His Highness and are petitioning further on the subject.
Nyanggow was well aware of the whereabouts of the two men as correspondence between them had been intercepted. He had previously offered to pay a fine for them but it had been refused and their surrender was demanded.
A Chinese of Bukit Lan was fined $300 for being in possession of 8 counterfeit ten cent notes. These notes were quite new and were but poor imitations. Information was given that a large number of those notes had been recently imported from Singapore direct to Sibu.
Public Works.The old Rangers quarters have been demolished and the Rangers have moved into the new barracks.
The repairs to the bazaar road have been completed the whole road having been raised, barrelled and gravelled. A large quantity of gravel has been worked and stacked for use on the various roads.
The Tamils have built a new path to No. 3 bungalow and gravelled it. They stripweeded the Laming road for two miles but as their baskets had not arrived they could not start repairing it. The up-river end of this road beyond the Saw Miil is in a very over-grown condition and it is quite impossible to use it: arrangements have been made to have it cleared and kept in order.
General.- I returned from Kuching by H. H. S. Y. Zahora on the 6th : the Yacht leaving for Lingga to fetch His Highness the next morning.
The 9th. being the anniversary of His Highness the Tuan Muda's birthday the offices were closed for the day.
The s. s. Sarawak arrived on the 6th. and the s, s. Alice Lorraine on the 18th.
There was no communication with Singapore during the month and a large amount of cargo accumulated in the bazaar, the s. s. Flevo apparently met with an accident and had to be docked and the s. s. Batavier which should have taken her place was also in dock.
I left for Mukah on the 16th, in the s. l. Chamois. Two appeals were heard the decision of the District Officer being upheld in each case. I walked over to Oya on the 31st.
The weather has been wet unsettled and stormy. Most of the Dayaks have not yet burnt off their clearings waiting for a spell of hot weather which they expected next month. The Chinese are busy enlarging their farms and a large area should be under padi this year.

I left for Balingean on 12th. per s. I. Mermaid and returned on 17th. But few cases were brought before me, and these were connected with breach of Jelutong regulations. The Dayaks were busy planting out padi. There was less work than usual in Court.
Haji Ismail for making false statements and tampering with certain land marks was heavily fined.
Two prisoners, Anthoni and Sampan escaped from custody and are still at large. Jabal, a prisoner who had escaped in the previous month was arrested in Balingean. Owing to the carelessness of P. C.

We shipned to Labuan 1,273 tons and supplied to p.s. .Adeh and local launches 142 tons.
We had in stock at the end of the month 118.25 tons.
Everything went smoothly in all departments. The two pumps, mentioned in my July report, as being under water, were recovered and brought to the surface for repairs.
Coal sales at Labuan amounted to 1,608 tons, as follows:
Straits Steamship Co.	1,426	tons

September.
With the farming season in full swing Court work has been lighter. If one may judge from the burning that has been going on, all over the district, the inhabitants are doing their utmost to ensure a successful padi crop next harvest.
Entinggang, a Dayak, was fined one picul for setting tukak. half the fine going to the injured party.
An application to erect a 16 h.p. motor saw-mill was refused, on the grounds that the site chosen was too near to the Court house, and other Government buildings. The applicant was advised to try and select a site elsewhere.
I was away at Brooketon from the 3rd. to the 7th. Here 1 cautioned those people who have let their gardens encroach onto the cattle ground, without written permission, to remove back to the boundary. The mowers resignation was accepted, as he is very asthmatic and quite unable to fulfil his contract. One Garib has now undertaken to do the work.
The Trusan squad S. R. whilst waiting at Brooketon for the Kuching steamer, cleared the cattle ground and the rentis for re-installing the telephone co His Highness the Rajahs bungalow.
Mr. MacBryan went to Lawas, for a change, from the 9th to the 16th.
Mr. W. F. de V. Skrine, D. O. Lawas came round to talk over official matters on the 10th. and returned at midnight on the 12th.
The British Resident in Brunei spent the day here on the 19th. Miss Swayne arrived that afternoon by the Adeh, from Bintulu.
I left in the Damit for Lawas via Sundar on the 21st. At Sundar I met Mr. Skrine, when the matter of the Awat-Awat Customs farm was discussed. The request of Ba Chee, the present holder, that he should be allowed to retain the same, at an increased rental, until the expiration of the Punang farm, on the 31st. May 1921, was acceded to.
Mr. Skrine was asked to inform the Sundar people, that they would not be allowed to erect houses on the buffalo alaman. and that the fences round them must be repaired. This question was very carefully gone into, by Mr. R. S. Douglas and Mr. D. A. Owen, several years ago, when special areas were set apart for buffalo grazing grounds, and were duly fenced off. During Mr. Skrine's absence from the district in 19181919, the inhabitants neglected to keep these up, and are now trying to worm their way into the, prohibited area. If this is permitted endless litigation must assuredly ensue once again.
On our way round to Lawas we went up the Marapok, stopping for a few minutes at Mr. Cook's jelutong factory, before calling at the bazaar.
I got back to Limbang at 9 a. m. on the 25th. The Damit was running very well. She only took 8 hours from Lawas.
The Adeh called in twice, as also did the Peter Duff. On one of her trips the Peter Duff brought in two Bornean ponies.
Eighty-live buffaloes were exported to Kuching. For the time being these are somewhat difficult to purchase, everybody being busily occupied farming.
The trade returns are as below :
Imports. Exports.
Coasting $10,538	$10,383

WE beg to announce that we have recently been appointed Sole Agents in Sarawak, Brunei and British North Borneo for Messrs. Joseph Travers & Sons, Limited, proprietors of the well-known SHIP" and SIGNAL" brands of TINNED PROVISIONS and are now ready to commence business on wholesale lines.
It is still impossible to obtain adequate supplies from England and the Colonies but the situation becomes easier week by week and we hope shortly to be able to meet all demands.
