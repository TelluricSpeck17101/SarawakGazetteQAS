Crude Rubber.
At the begining of March, an open letter to Pack- ers and Shippers of Crude Rubber to America was published in the Singapore press. The letter was issued by the Rubber .Manufacturers Association of America and The Rubber Trade Association of New York jointly and, inter alia, states “While the American Buyers are fully cognisant of some of the difficulties that have been encountered since the re-occupation of Malaya, they are of the opinion that grading can and should be improved through proper supervision.................etc.”
If the American buyers are fully cognisant of some of the rubber producers’ difficulties, then they will probably be aware that an important handicap to im- proved production and grading during the past twelve months has been the wildly fluctuating price for crude rubber. At the time of writing No. 1 R.S.S. is quoted on the local market at about $40.50 per
picul (two days ago it was $41.66); twelve months ago the price stood at $46.50. On 31st May, 1947, it fell abruptly to $30.33 : in June to $28.50 and continued at a depressed level until November when the market steadied around the forties. Forward sales No. 1 R.S.S. are quoted at $40.50, but this is a form of marketing to which Sarawak has still to accustom itself. To what extent the American policy on stock-piling or on guarding her synthetic rubber industry has influenced these wildly fluctuat- ing prices, we cannot say, but the uncertainty of the market has militated strongly against any far sighted policy for development of production by either the large estate or by the small-holder. With a steady demand and a steady price, the catch-as- catch-can idea, which is a feature of Sarawak rubber production, must disappear. With a secure future, the producer can afford to develop his holding on more rational lines instead of waiting for the good period in which to recoupe losses of the bad.
In 1941, the price of No. 1 R.S.S. was hovering round $45 to $47, materially higher it will be noted than today’s quotations, and at that time the following appeared in the Economist “the industry ..........will be able to continue operating at a fairly high level of its capacity and at a reasonable margin of profit.”
If the industry showed a ‘reasonable margin of profit’ on the 1941 figures then the 1947 figures must indicate a bare subsistence level. Enforced reduct- ion in dollar expenditure precludes any accurate comparison of the rise in prices between 1941 and 1947 for imports from America but it is reasonably safe to suggest that such prices must have risen to at least twice the pre-war cost. This in contrast to the price of crude rubber which is now below its pre-war price level and which at times during the previous year sank to almost half of the pre-war price.
From Sarawak’s production, there is a tendency for the lower grades (at substantially lower prices) to be shipped to America and the better grades to go to Europe with a marked preference on the part of the local exporters to seek the European markets. Even when other bids are fractionally lower than American offers, there is a clear preference for the lower bid rather than face the possibility of heavy claims from the American importers.
We agree that the standard of Sarawak rubber sheet is not high but until the world markets afford something better than marginal production, the producer in this country is going to have an up-hill battle to improve the standard of his rubber garden and modernise his methods of production.
Visit of Lord Listowel to Sarawak.
The Rt. Hon. the Earl of Listowel, p.c., Minis- ter of State for Colonial Affairs, who was accom- panied by Mr. Sidebotham, c.M.G., of the Colonial Office, and by his Private Secretary, Mr. Pearson, arrived at the Kuching airstrip at Seventh mile by R.A.F. Dakota shortly after noon on Monday, the 8th March, where he was met by His Excellency the Governor, accompanied by the Chief Secretary and Private Secretary. En route to the Astana. Lord Listowel inspected a Constabulary guard of honour drawn up at Pangkalan Batu.
In the evening His Excellency the Governor gave a pahit party at the Astana at which over one hun- dred and thirty members of all communities were presented to Lord Listowel. Music was supplied by the Constabulary Band.
The following day’s engagements began before breakfast with a visit to the Constabulary Depot, where Lord Listowel saw aspects of recruits’ train- ing, including the spectacular assault course.
The remainder of the morning was taken up with visits to Batu Lintang, where temporary buildings are being prepared for the Secondary School and Teacher Training College, the Agriculture Depart- ment’s small scale experimental land settlement scheme, the Maderasah Melayu, and finally to the Musuem where, in the absence of the Curator, Messrs. Archer and Banks kindly acted as guides. On these visits the party was augmented by Miss Mary Trevelyan, who was paying a brief visit to Sarawak on behalf of UNESCO.
After lunch Lord Listowel gave a series of inter- views, commencing with the Datus and followed by representatives of the Y.M.A. and of the anti- cession Associations. The Chinese Consul, Dr. Chan, paid a courtesy call, and was followed by re- presentatives of the Chinese Associations. Lord Listowel concluded a busy afternoon with a press conference.
In the evening Lord Listowel was the guest of honour at a dinner party given by the Chinese Con- sul at the Teo Khiaw Association Club.
The following day, in order to provide the visitors with a brief glimpse of the countryside and a small cross-section of its peoples, Lord Listowel and party, accompanied by the Governor, the Chief Secretary and the Resident, motored out to Serian. The party paused at the twenty-sixth mile, where the Director of Agriculture pointed out the panora- ma of hill and swamp padi cultivation. A passing Land Dayak of uncertain age and cleanliness, on holiday owing to a local pantang, shook hands all round and competed with the Director of Agricul- ture's explanation of swamp padi development plans until persuaded to desist.
A short distance further on the party was met by the District Officer, Serian, Mr. Roberts, pre- cariously perched on the pillion of a small motor cycle.
No stop had been arranged at the thirty-second mile bazaar, but the local Chinese thought other- wise. so another short pause was made while Lord Listowel was greeted by the Capitan China, and inspected the boy scouts and pupils of the Chung Hua school.
It was a source of disappointment to certain thirsty members of the party who caught a glimpse of cool-looking bottles of beer that, owing to shortage of time, the preferred hospitality had to be declined.
On arrival at Tarat Agriculture Station, after much hand shaking with local Land Dayaks, the party was shown round the experimental plots by the Director of Agriculture and the Agricultural Officer, First Division, Mr. Kay.
Lord Listowel was next taken to visit the Land Dayaks at Kampong Rayong. As the cars stopped opposite the track leading to the kampong each mem- ber of the party was enthusiastically grasped by either hand by attractive girls and thus escorted throughout the visit to the kampong. Although the path had been cleared the double escort proved somewhat difficult when negotiating the occasional batang. This pleasant custom, though doubtless a surprise to those not aware of it, was much appre- ciated by the whole party.
The walk to Kampong Rayong proved very warm, but on arrival refreshing drinks of coconut milk were provided.
Serian itself was reached at 12.30 and the party proceeded straight to the District Officer's bungalow for a curry lunch.
In the afternoon Lord Listowel talked with local Land Dayak and Malay headmen in the District Officer’s bungalow, then inspected the Malay and R.C. Mission Schools and the Government Offices. After walking through the bazaar a visit was paid to the Chinese School, where bunches of flowers were presented by small girls to Lord Listowel and His Excellency the Governor, somewhat to the chargrin of their respective Private Secretaries, who were both unaccustomed to handling bouquets.
The party then left Serian at 3.30 p.m. and arrived at Kuching two hours later, which reflects the improvement in the condition of the road.
On Thursday morning, after giving a final inter- view to representatives of anti-cession elements, Lord Listowel and party were seen off at Pending by His Excellency the Governor and the Chief Secretary, leaving at 10.30 by R.A.F. Sunderland en route for Brunei. Thus concluded the first visit of a Minister of the Crown to this Colony.
The following letter was addressed by Lord Listowel to His Excellency the Governor a short time after the conclusion of his visit to Sarawak.
Government House.
Jesselton.
The 16th March, 1948.
My dear Governor,
I have very much enjoyed my visit to Sarawak and regret very much that I could not. have stayed longer in such a beautiful country and among such friendly people.
During my short stay I have, thanks to the way in which the time was organized by yourself and your officers, managed to see a certain amount of what is going on in Sarawak, and to discuss affairs with various representative bodies. These things will I am sure help me to do my work at the Colonial Office very much better, and with more appreciation of the special circumstances in Sarawak.
I was most heartened by what I saw of your development projects.
The experimental work which is going on to discover better agricultural methods, the suitability of new crops and so on, should help to provide a basis for an improved standard of life. I am glad
to see that progress is being made in the construction
of a teachers' training school, which will
play its part by making possible the higher degree
of education necessary to open every career to those
with ability, and to give the knowledge required for
better living standards. I hope that successful
advances will before long provide for yet another
basic requirement; namely better health, and I am
pleased to see that this too is a feature of your
development plan.
Obituary.
It is with deep regret that we announce the
death of Inche Haji Mohammed Zin, Datu Mentri,
on the 5th of February at his home in Kuching.
The Datu Mentri was born in 1871 and entered the
Government Service in 1890 as a Malay School
Teacher. On the 24th June, 1907, he was
appointed Tua of Lower Kampong and Member of
the Supreme Council: on the 26th September.
1928, His Highness the Rajah appointed him to
be Datu Mentri.
In 1941, His Highness the Rajah wrote of the
Datu Mentri : “This Datu has been a loyal and
devoted officer of long standing service and I commend
him to the favourable consideration of the
Committee, knowing full well that there is no
Member of that Committee who will fail to
recognise his oustanding merit.”
Ellin anak Masing v. The King.
At this time, no civil Courts were functioning.
In his summing up. the Chief Justice said “It is
a fundamental principle of international law that
military occupation involves no transfer of
sovereignty, but a military occupant acquires
certain rights and becomes subject to certain duties.
The British interpretation of Article 23 (ft) of the
Hague Regulations is that it prohibits an occupant
of enemy territory from declaring extinguished,
suspended, or unenforceable in a court of law, the
rights and the rights of action of the inhabitants.
Article 43 provides that the occupant must respect,
unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the
country.
A military occupant may suspend the judges and
magistrates as well as other officials, but if he does
he must temporarily appoint others in their
place. The decisions of Courts during the period of
Japanese occupation, given in accordance with
Sarawak law or with such regulations as the enemy
was lawfully entitled to prescribe, are prima facie
valid. On this subject I will quote that eminent
authority, Sir Arnold McNair, now a Judge of the
International Court of Justice :
The Supreme Court judgment in the case of Ellin
anak Masing v. The King, heard on the 22nd March
before the Hon. the Chief Justice (Dr. R. Y.
Hedges) is of considerable interest in relation to
Japanese decisions during the period of the
occupation.
The facts, briefly, are that the appellant was convicted
of murder in the Resident’s Court, Third
Division on 4th December, 1941. An appeal was
lodged but before the appeal could be heard the
Japanese Forces had occupied Kuching; the appeal
was brought to the attention of a Japanese police
officer, Takai, who sentenced the appellant to ten
years' imprisonment.
“Thus we apprehend that if the enemy were
to occupy the Scilly Isles (we refrain from
mentioning the Channel Islands because they
have their own legal system) all the ordinary
transactions of private law taking place in
accordance with English law during the enemy
administration, such as constructs, dispositions of
movables and immovables, devolution of property
by will or upon intestacy, and all normal official
transactions such as the collection of ordinary
taxes, would, at the end of the occupation, be
treated as valid, and all judgments, civil and
criminal, given in accordance with the English
law or with such regulations as the enemy
was lawfully entitled to prescribe, would be
respected. ”
In the ease before me there were no civil Courts
functioning at the material date—January 1942-
and there was no Court competent therefore to
entertain an appeal. In any case a sentence of ten
years’ imprisonment was not in accordance with
Sarawak law . but my decision rests on the ground
that there was no competent Court.
The conviction and sentence of death was confirmed
but a strong recommendation for mercy was
made to be forwarded to His Excellency the
Governor.
The Government of the United Kingdom is most
anxious that Sarawak should be a prosperous
country, inhabited by a united and contented people
capable of advancing towards self government in
common with the other dependencies of the Crown.
The foundations are being laid under your inspiring
leadership, and with the support of your able and
conscientious officers. I wish the whole great
enterprise the greatest and most lasting success.
In conclusion I should like to say how grateful
I am to yourself, your officers and the many people
whom I have seen and met, for their most friendly
and courteous reception, and their willingness at
all times to help me to make my visit a success.
Yours sincerely.
(Signed) Listowel.
His Excellency Sir C. N. Arden Clarke, k.c.m.g.,

The Governor opens Fort Arundell.
On Monday, February 23rd, His Excellency the Governor accompanied by the Deputy Chief Secret- ary, Mr. R. G. Aikman, Miss Jenifer Arden Clarke and the Private Secretary, travelled to Simanggang in the new launch “La Follette.”
This was His Excellency’s first trip in the “La Follette” which by her superior speed, accommod- ation, and, above all, hick of noise, is luxurious by comparison with other launches.
On landing at Simanggang His Excellency was greeted by the Honourable the Resident and other Government officers, inspected the Constabulary guard of honour, and shooks hands with local notables.
The following morning the party, augmented by the Honourable the Resident, Mr. Ditmas, and the District Officer, Mr. Jacks, left in the “La Follette” for Engkilili.
At Engkilili a stop of three quarters of an hour was made for lunch, prior to which His Excellency inspected the Guard of Honour and met local notables. The party then continued the journey to Lubok Antu in a fleet of three outboards. Owing to the motors being new the trip was completed with- out mechanical breakdowns or other untoward incidents, and Lubok Antu was reached shortly before 6 p.m.
As on the occasion of His Excellency's previous visit, the path between the landing stage and the Guard of Honour was strewn with pigs laid out by the Penghulus for ceremonial slaughter. After His Excellency, now well accustomed to this ritual, had speared two pigs, the Resident and the District Officer dispatched a pig each, whilst Mr. R. G. Aikman, whose boat had fallen behind, arrived in time to deal with the remaining victim.
After inspecting the Guard of Honour and being greeted by the Datu Abang Zin, Native Officer Abang Abdul Latip, Penghulus and other notables. His Excellency walked round the new fort, which is a handsome concrete building erected on the site of the old building burnt down in 1945. The lower floor consists of offices and police station, whilst above are the Court room and an airy sitting room and verandah off which lead two bedrooms, each with bathrooms on the same level fitted with running water and modern sanitation.
Before dinner His Excellency had an informal talk with the Ulu Ai Penghulus.
On Wednesday, February 25th at 10 a.m. His Excellency performed the ceremonial opening of the new fort. A Constabulary Guard was drawn up in front of the fort and behind them gathered a large crowd of Ibans. His Excellency stood on the steps of the fort , and first of all presented the Bri- tish Empire Medal to Pengarah Jimbun. who, as Penghulu Jimbun, organised the Than of the Ulu Ai and led them against the Japanese, in the course of which operations the old fort was burnt down.
His Excellency then made the following speech, which was ably translated into Iban, sentence by sentence, by the Government clerk. Mr. Sanggat Broke :—
“Ibans, people of Lubok Antu, you asked Govern- ment that a kubu should be built to replace the one burnt during the operations against the Japanese.
When I was last here, I promised you that a new kubu would be built and I said that I hoped that when I next came to visit you, the work would be done and I should be able to open it. That was less than nine months ago. Government has kept its promise. I am here today to open your new kubu.
This is a building of which you may be proud. I have travelled all over Sarawak and stayed in many kubus all over the country. This is the finest of them all. It is the first that has been built since the war ended. This is a sign to you that the Government has your interests at heart and will give you the guidance and leadership that you need if the people of the Ulu Ai are to progress and prosper.
This is not the only new building that has been put up. More is needed than a kubu for your wel- fare. A fine new dispensary has been built. The framework of an Iban School has been built. But not everything can be left to Government. If you are to go forward, you too must share in the work and effort. Your share in all this is to complete the school and as soon as you have done it, Govern- ment will send you a teacher. Government has done well by you; see that you do well by yourselves and make a good job of your school.
I was glad when I received your request that this new kubu should be named after Mr. Arundell, whom you all remember as Tuan Rundu. He spoke your language; he knew your adat; he was a real friend and adviser to you. He spent the best years of his life working for the Iban. He was done to death by outlaws, agents of the Japanese, who have paid the extreme penalty for their foul crime. It is right and fitting that the memory of Tuan Run- du should be kept alive here in the Ulu Ai, where he lived and worked for many years, and this kubu should be named after him so that he and the fine work he did for the Iban will be remembered not only by his friends who are alive today but by their children, and their children’s children.
I name this fort ‘Fort Arundell’ and declare it open.”
His Excellency then unveiled a plaque above the entrance bearing the name “Fort Arundell.” As this was done a cannon was fired by the Con- stabulary.
The rest of the morning was spent inspecting the new police barracks and other buildings erected at the station, following which His Excellency and party attended a curry luncheon in the Court room attended by Government Officers, Penghulus, and, very appropriately, the Malay contractor responsible for the construction work.
In the afternoon a large crowd watched a regatta. There was no lack of competitors for the poling, paddliug and swimming races. The duck in the “catching the duck race” also displayed sporting instincts and was only caught with difficulty, whilst the greasy pole was finally climbed by the combined efforts of about half a dozen childem. At the conclusion His Excellency presented the prizes.
The Regatta Committee is to be congratulated on a most successful regatta, with no fouls barred, no objections lodged, and everyone happy and smiling.
After dinner a ngajat took place, also attended by a vast crowd, but the dancers were slow in coming forward, and the credit for the best perform- ance must go to the District Officer, Mr. H. P. K. Jacks.
The following day the party left on the return trip, stopping for 1 1/2 hours at Engkilili, during which His Excellency heard requests, and arriving at Simanggang by mid-afternoon.
The final of the Simanggang Dayak Football Competition was played in pouring rain, which, however, did not appear to mar the enthusiasm of either players or spectators. His Excellency presented the Cup to the winners and medals to both teams.
In the evening His Excellency was the guest of honour at a dinner given by the Simanggang Recreation Club.
The following day His Excellency met members of the Simanggang Native Treasury, and inspected the station. A dinner party given by the Honour- able the Resident concluded a most enjoyable visit.
His Excellency and party returned to Kuching on Saturday, 28th by “La Follette" without discom- fort on the sea crossing.
Notes and Comments.
The Right Honourable the Earl of Listowel, P.C., Minister of State for Colonial Affairs arrived in Kuching on the 8th March for a short visit. This is the first time in the history of the Colony that a Minister of State has visited Kuching. A full account of his stay in Sarawak is described in this issue.
In recent months there has been a spate of legis- lation, and many a head, aching from the increasing complexity of the law, has sought the palliative of the traditional ice pack.
A correspondent forwards a specimen of some- one else’s ‘headache’ (Section 1 (4) of the Mandated and Trust Territories Act, 1947) which we repro- duce in the hope that it may provide a counter- irritant for the Sarawak migraine.
“The foregoing provisions of this Act, except the last foregoing subsection, shall apply only to enactments contained in Acts of earlier sessions than this Act, and to enactments contained in instruments having effect under such Acts, and the application of the foregoing provisions of this Act to enactments contained in instruments having effect under any Act may be excluded in whole or in part by any instrument having effect under that Act."
The Kuching Boys’ Home, intended for the reception and education of youthful offenders, has been established at Sungei Priok, Kuching, in the vicinity of the Dairy Farm. The boys are housed in a comfortable wooden hut and spend part of their time assisting on the farm: in due course, they will have a full time teacher.
The accommodation is limited and, for the time being, it will be possible to accommodate a total of twenty-one boys only in the Home.
The reformative influence of the Home upon young delinquents should be considerable.
In the January issue of the “Sarawak Gazette” there was a report by an Agricultural Officer (Mr. Kay) of a trip in Ulu Gedong in which he relates a story current in Kampong Merbau. When the Gazette reached Bareo, the Government Ethnologist
(Mr. Harrisson) promptly wrote to us expressing his appreciation of the report and urging that publicity should be given to the need for reporting any legends for fuller enquiry at a later date. In Ins letter. Mr. Harrisson adds “Stories of petrified village have seldom been recorded from central and south Sarawak, and Mr. Kay’s note is of interest and value in extending the area of this curious belief. Such ‘stonehouses’ are common in the Fifth Division and on the Kelabit Plateau, as well as among the Muruts of northern Dutch Borneo and B.N.B. I have recorded a number of legends connected with them. Generally the line in the interior is that someone made fun of a dog, a fowl, or a rat; at once, hail fell and covered in the whole longhouse. Near Lawas on the Merapok River one such was caused by sending a dog across river to a village on the other side, with lighted wood attached to its tail (the other village had asked for a light!). At Batu Patong, in the headwaters of the Baram, another such was due to a giant toad being dressed up as a woman, to everyone’s amuse- ment. At Pa Bawang in Dutch Borneo, and on the Seridan River, a tributary of the Baram, these petrified villages have caves within, the former containing interesting earthernware and other utensils. The fear of petrification is very strong among the Kelabits, and one of their principal head- hunting rites was to prevent hail. Mr. Kay’s reference to a hollowed-out stone containing a crocodile made of Brunei earth is another valuable link. The crocodile-figure cult was very strong among the Muruts,—probably the original people of Brunei. And the hollowing out of stones is a special feature of Murut-Kelabit culture. Only this week I excavated a large rock with four man- made cavelets at Po Dali, finding beads, stone and iron implements, and pottery of interest.
Notes such as Mr. Kay's are most helpful, and the Gazette does well to print them. The folklore of Sarawak is rapidly vanishing. Sarawak will later regret that it has neglected a proud past. Now is the time to record all that can be recaptured.”
Fortunately, we are able to add a little more fuel to Mr. Harrisson’s fire. The Cadet Officer, Sibu, in his travels came across a belian monolith at the junction of Sungei Retus and Batang Igan and a short report is included in this month’s News from Far and Near.
Some Notes on the Census.
The first official and complete enumeration of the population of Sarawak was carried out in 1939 as an emergency measure to introduce a food ration- ing scheme. The terms of reference for the enumera- tion proceedings were of necessity dictated by the demands of the rationing scheme with the result that the enumeration was little more than a reason- ably accurate count of the people by “race.”
The limited value of this enumeration as a reliable basis for investigation and development had completely disappeared by 1947, not only be- cause of a complete absence of vital and external migration statistics during the Japanese occupat- ion, but also because it was apparent that consider- able movements of population had taken place within the country since 1939. The use of these out-of- date statistics would result in a faulty framework
for schemes with consequent waste and inefficiency. Accordingly it was decided to conduct a full scale population census without further delay.
The Census office was opened on 21st April, 1947 and almost immediately afterwards the Superin- tendent proceeded to Ipoh to consult the Superin- tendent of Census, Malaya, who was at that time carrying out a census of Malaya. Very much useful information was obtained and when the Superin- tendent returned he was able to commence organisation at once, adapting the Malayan pro- cedure where it suited but instituting some important changes to suit the special conditions of Sarawak.
As an indication of the amount of preliminary work necessary it may be mentioned that 48 different forms of various sizes were designed and drafted. Some of them ran into many pages and a good proportion was translated into Rumi.
A population Census in countries such as Sarawak must necessarily be divided into three phases, the first of which is House Numbering and involves the numbering of all houses and counting of all the people in order to get an idea of the population and density. With the House Numbering inform- ation it is then possible to divide the country into Enumerators' Blocks, the size of each of which is governed by the ability of the Enumerator to cover his Block completely in a certain period and collect and record all Census particulars of each individual resident therein. The second phase is called Pre- liminary Enumeration, involving one visit at least to each house by the Enumerator under the watch- ful eye of his Supervisor to collect all the information required for the Census. The third phase, Final Enumeration, involves a further visit by the Enu- merator to each house on or about a certain date in order to correct the schedules to that date. This is clearly necessary as some persons may have died, births may have occurred, some people may have left the Block and others may have come in. The last operation must be carried out with the utmost care, but usually corrections are not numerous and the work can be done in a fraction of the time it takes for the second operation. During the third phase several refinements appear. For example, people resident on vessels must be enumerated, homeless people must be interviewed, travellers must be intercepted, and nomadic people must be gathered together. Accuracy is absolutely essential throughout and the greatest care must be taken to see that no person is enumerated twice, and that no one is missed. The Enumerator is watched by his Supervisor, who in turn is under a Chief Super- visor for the District, and the Chief Supervisor is answerable to his Assistant Superintendent for the particular Census District. Twenty Assistant Superintendents were appointed with twenty-one Chief Supervisors under them. The House Num- berers amounted to 338. and during the second and third phases 194 Supervisors and 702 Enumerators were employed.
Three factors governed the period and final date of Census. Firstly, the Census Office could not be opened until 21st. April: secondly, the Census was to be carried out during 1947: and thirdly, field operations could not be extended too deeply into the wet or “landas” season without endangering the accuracy of the undertaking. It was decided to make the zero hour midnight of 26th/27th. Novem- ber. 1947. allowing three months and twenty-four days for the field operations—a period which it was
thought at first might be dangerously short as Malaya had allowed five months. Having fixed this final date, it then became necessary carefully to plan every minute operation and dovetail instruct- ions and programmes. This, in a country such as Sarawak where communications are almost wholly by sea or river, involves very careful planning and subsequently closest attention to progress in each District. When it is remembered that only a limit- ed time can be allowed for the training of each employee : that the House Numberer or Enumerator usually must travel by “prau” to get to his Block, and once within it probably must continue by the same means ; that journeys from anything up to 100 miles must be made by this means in rivers often dangerously in flood: then it will he realised how carefully attention must be paid to details of organisation.
The whole undertaking was carried through successfully without failure on the part of any one of the 702 Enumerators to cover his Block adequate- ly. Each Assistant Superintendent reported that every house in his district had been covered and the only possibility of failure to enumerate occurred in the Baram District where it is thought that a few of the nomadic Punans may have been missed. In some of the more distant Blocks the Enumerators may have reached their houses a few days after the final date, but this was not important as the inhabitants of these areas were fully aware of the important events of birth and death and arrivals and departures. It was unfortunate that bad weather set in throughout the country just before the 26th November and continued unabated to the end of the year, resulting in some of the Enumerators be- coming waterbound within their Blocks and being unable to get back to Headquarters until some time after the date expected, with the result that ex- penditure on this final phase of Census increased greatly.
This is perhaps the appropriate place to pay a tribute to all those men who worked so hard and faithfully in the field to make the Census a success. It was found difficult in the beginning to recruit men with anything more than a smattering of education, and at first fears for the accuracy of the Census were felt on that account. However it was found in the end that the best work came from the ma- jority of the lesser educated employees who followed their instructions meticulously and did not resort to any evasive practices. A few of the better edu- cated, on the other hand, could not be bothered to memorise instructions and used their superior knowledge to justify laziness. Occasionally it became necessary to replace a few of this class as the work proceeded and sometimes the Supervisors were required to step in and fill the gaps.
A few persons in Kuching and Sibu showed a disposition at the commencement of House Num- bering to oppose the Census on grounds which may have been political, but all opposition disappeared as the work progressed and by the end of Census any fears which may have been felt by members of the public that the Census would be used for political purposes, or taxation, or conscription or any other ill-founded and erroneous idea, had been allay- ed. Perhaps it would be as well to repeat here that which has been said so often, that the Census was undertaken with no political motive, that it is entirely impersonal, and that its aim is to create a foundation for the social and economic develop- ment of the people of Sarawak. It might be as
well to mention also that almost the whole cost is being borne, not by the people of Sarawak, but by the British Taxpayers in the form of grants from the Colonial Development and Welfare Vote.
The public on the whole co-operated magnifi- cently. From the commencement the policy of the Census Department in its relations with the public had been laid down as conciliation and per- suasion although a perfectly adequate Census Enact- ment existed for enforcement if necessary. Once again the traditionally co-operative attitude of the people of Sarawak appeared, and the annoyance and tedium of questioning and cross-question- ing was accepted with good-humour and without complaint. Indeed, certain Assistant Superin- tendents of Districts containing large numbers of Sea Dayaks reported that their people were actually enjoying the Census, and looked upon the question- ing and recording of the apparently multifarious and irrelevant particulars as a surprising but pleasing interest in each individual by the Govern- ment. Two rather amusing incidents occurred about a week after the final date of Census, when two elderly Chinese separately appeared at the Cen- sus Headquarters in Kuching and stated that they wished to report their arrival in Kuching. They had been enumerated somewhere in the country during the Census, but as they were moving to Kuching they thought the Census Office might wish to record the change in address. They were thank- ed for their thoughtfulness.
One popular misconception of Census is that it is merely a count of the people in order to find out how many there are. Naturally this inform- ation is most important, but if the Census had no other use it would be quite unjustified in the ex- penditure of labour and money. Social and econo- mic development organisations and in fact all administrative branches of Government rely for the accuracy and efficient development of schemes and projects and for administrative improvement upon such information as the relationship of the sexes, the numbers within the age groups (particul- the lower ones), particulars of country of birth, “race” (or, in these modern times, “cultural group”), religion, fertility statistics, standards of literacy, occupations and industrial groups. There is no need to enlarge upon the value of this ad- ditional information as no doubt the very mention of it is sufficient to suggest some of the important uses to which it can be put. Before a Census can be taken the decision must be made regarding the maximum number and extent of the questions that may be asked of each individual. The questions must he carefully balanced so that they do not over- lap and yet supply a co-ordinated story, their value must be weighed one with another, and care must be taken that the set of questions is not too long or too complicated. In the end it was decided to ask a maximum of 14 questions per person so that in the end about seven and one half million answers were received, and recorded on schedules.
The sorting of all this information and tabulation is a complicated operation which, if done by hand, would mean the employment of a very large staff. Under modern conditions it is however possible to extract the information by making use of mechanical methods. First of all the entries must be checked and coded. Mistakes are corrected, often by further questioning of the persons against the names of whom the erroneous entries appear, and the coding is done bv giving each entry a code
number worked out previously in accordance with a complete plan. This work has now been done and the schedules have been sent to Malaya for the mechanical statistical analysis. To effect this, each individual in Sarawak will be represented by a separate card, and the information on the schedule pertaining to that individual will be recorded on the card by means of punched boles made with a machine something like a typewriter, each hole occupying a position on the card in accordance with the code numbers previously set on the card. These cards are arranged in various groups by District and then put through special machines which sort them according to the information requir- ed. The extraction of information appears com- plicated, but in fact is not so. because the whole operation is carefully planned beforehand and follows a system which makes it almost error-proof.
When the statistical analysis has been completed the information will be tabulated and correlated, and will appear towards the end of 1948 in the form of a Census Report, copies of which will be available for purchase by the public.
Coding of the schedules was done in Kuching in December. 1947 and January and February, 1948, and concurrently preliminary information was extracted in respect of the numbers of people by race and sex in each Enumerator’s Block. These Blocks cover the whole country like a jig-saw puzzle, none of them overlap, and they fit into Sub- Districts. which in turn fit into Districts which combine to make Divisions, and so in the end we have complete figures for the whole country. The figures obtained should prove reasonably accurate and can be used for all practical purposes, but slight adjustments may take place in consequence of small changes (principally between the sexes) made subsequent to the preliminary analysis the result of which is shown as an appendix to be published next month with the second half of this article.

Stories of Old Sarawak.
By Jimini ! After reading the alliterative eructat- ions of “One of the Old Brigade” in your last Gazette I hardly dare put my pen to paper. I suppose we all write barbouillage from time to time. To his old tag “magna est veritas et praevalebit” I reply “de gustibus non est disputandum.” And so, having shown off our erudition, I had better get on with this, the last instalment, of my senile anecdotal history of three and a half decades ago.
As a matter of fact I realise now that I must watch my step. They tell me that a deputation of irate matrons thought seriously of waiting on the Chief Secretary to complain of my lewd tale about the old Kuching jail. Had I been on the mat for this I feel that any attempt of mine to quote a precedent might have failed. You remember of course (anyway, the old’uns do) the “Pink Un’s” reply to one of its correspondents “Too warm for us. Try the Sarawak Gazette.”
Sarawak in 1912 was enjoying the end of its heydays. The last great war had been the affair in South Africa, and bar a Melanau policeman we all called Lord Kitchener on account of his moust-
ache, and a gentleman who after a gin or two loved telling us about the joys of the Base at Cape Town, that campaign had left no visible mark on the country.
Cadets came out on a hundred dollars a month and the five years furlough was a thing of recent memory. One of my first outstation acquaintances was just about to go home after a full ten years service. He looked extremely healthy and I am certain that he did not have an electrolux either.
The whole European Civil Service numbered less than fifty, of which about twenty-one were in outstations, the same number in Kuching and the rest on leave or knocking about somewhere. Except for the staff of the two Government collieries there were no Departmental officers outside Kuching. There was no wireless, no electric light Except, I think, in Bau), hut one motor-car. no buses, no cocktail parties and no slap-and-tickle dancing. Those ladies who wore European dress would not have been seen dead in the street without a monster hat or topi; those who wore Malay dress covered their shy heads with gay sarongs and veils; only the older Chinese women were ever seen in public.
Lofty masted schooners lay in the creek off Sibu Maleng. The Second Division was served by sail- ing bandongs, propelled up the rivers by the crew sweating at the sweeps; steam vessels and launches laboriously pounded along with sparks sometimes flying from the funnel from the wood fuel.
In Kuching Lee Wai Heng made us good white suits for three dollars sixty and a khaki one was four dollars and a half. Hap Shin would make white canvas shoes for a dollar twenty. Syn Hin Leong. Chong Kim Eng (who is still with us) and Ban Jui Long had good whisky at under a dollar a bottle, and for the same sum you could get nearly three tins of cigarettes. If you went the right way about it it was possible to charter a smart ricksha to take you to and from the office every day, and a few odd extra trips thrown in, for fifteen dollars a month, and you could send all the washing you liked to a dhobie for a monthly payment of four dollars.
Sebah, known to everyone, brought round real kain tenun for a couple of dollars apiece, and she was pleasant company too. Good gold, as pure as one could wish for. could be bought over the counter from Kong Chan for a bit over four and a half doll- ars an amas, real gold sovereigns about nine dollars, half a quid for four fifty and a real whopper of an American gold piece for about seventeen dollars. Belts made of silver dollars cost their face value plus an equal amount for labour. Every year the pawn farmers used to melt down the unredeemed gold, and I have handled lumps of the stuff. Doesn’t that make the present currency regulations sound bosh !
In Singapore the police arrested Sarawak Dayaks for walking round Raffles Place in a chawat, cables were received from England and Singapore via Labuan. the festival of chap goh meh was the only time one saw Chinese girls, and the idea of "Women’s Day" or processions of gaily clad mem- bers of Kaum Ibu was a thing which no man, brown, yellow or white, could dream of. Once a year hordes of little Malay boys went over to the Astana to eat the Rajah’s curry, and on New Year’s Day there was a monster regatta. Tuba fishings were always great occasions. In outstations everyone nearby took a holiday. Government servants includ- ed, and even if the catches were hot often great the
fun was. Most of the tuba was secreted for private fishings up small streams the next day.
In Limbang they raced buffaloes, and in Sibu we spent half the landas roaming about in small boats. When the officers in Mukah and Oya got bored they went pukat fishing with the police and prisoners. In Bintulu they went to Kedurong to catch rock cod and cast a jala.
Sarawak Rangers paraded with snider rifles and sword bayonets : at headquarters they still exercised in “form hollow square to receive cavalry!” The Rajah’s yacht “Zahora” lay off Kuching with a three-pounder hotchkiss mounted on the forecastle.
Up in the outstations administrators and people lived a feudal but by no means an uncolourful life. Now and again a head-hunting foray livened up things, occasionally Chinese gang robbers threw pepper in travellers' eyes and got away with the spoils. A sporting District Officer, out after snipe, was gored by an angry buffalo. In Limbang an un- happy Chinese tried to commit hara kiri and was saved and lived happily ever after by the efforts of the Resident and his assistant who pushed in his entrails, sewed him up and then gave him a good shaking to get them into place.
One or two small motor boats were introduced at this time and the Malays, ever quick to catch on to a good nickname, called them by a most expressive word. Rajah Brooke drove around Kuch- ing in a wagonette, or sometimes a governess cart: the manager of the B.C.L. had a dashing dog cart. Silk-hatted gentlemen went to Church on Sunday evenings and bottle-green tails appeared at Astana functions.
No one seemed to have much money; in any case few of the merchants seemed to use it. For raw sago the Kuching towkays sent up cargoes of tobacco, cloth, pots and pans, hurricane lamps, braces and sock suspenders and Dr. Williams Pink Pills.
The State was not run on orthodox lines, and I suppose that some modern thinkers would say that it was sheer autocracy, oligarchy and despotic benevolence, and of course so it was. It was run very well. But it could not have gone on much longer. The first world war shook it a bit but left the foundations cracked but standing. The second world war finished it off.
Politics are tricky things and a persuasive tongue and pen can make one believe almost anything. It has been said that the Constitution of 1941 was the panacea for all the ills of Sarawak; it was not. It was the pill to palliate the sickness which had been growing for some time.
In 1945 the time had come to realise that old Sarawak was creaking. Good for a few years more, perhaps, but going for all that. Of course the people, who are the ones that matter, had a senti- mental affection for the old regime and so too did the men who had worked for so long in the adminis- tration. be they Asiatic or European.
Regrets, tears and recriminations are vain. The old love is gone and the new one is here. Don’t you think we ancients should say “omnia mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis,” which, to the shock of mv classical friends I would translate as DON’T DAYDREAM. GET CRACKIN!
O.F.

Glory and Honour.
To THE SECOND RAJAH.
“It was one of the biggest private estates in the world,”—Mr. William Teeling M.P. on Sarawak in the House of Commons on February 18th, 1948.
Rajah! whose wide domains thy servant sees, The home of cultured beauty, leisured grace;
The village children being taught their place;
The slinking parson bowing at the knees;
The parish tawaks tinkling in the breeze;
The screams of Kayan dairymaids at play;
The rustic burring of bazaar Malay;
The scented blossom of the durian trees;
The servile Dayaks touching of their caps;
The barbed wire fence to keep the monkeys snug,
And wooden boards erect at all the gaps To warn the trespasser he'll go to jug .
My soul with ecstasy expires, Thou most magnificent of squires !
Reply.
“It must be clearly understood and recognised that the State of Sarawak is not private property and that it does not in any way belong to a Company of shareholders or speculators.”—The “political will” of the second Rajah.
For sixty years and more I served that land, I gave her all the best that in me lay, Not once but many times, I turned at bay, When my own people would not understand. And shall it now be said that this, my hand, Fashioned a park, a playground for my heirs, Some capital divided into shares, Distilling money from my fiery brand ?
When sunset comes, come soon the shadows stealing,
When great bells break, the little bells start pealing;
When lips are sealed, the truth demands unsealing;
You wrong me and my story, Mr. Teeling.
My would-be friends, ponder your words and save
Unquiet to the Rajah in his grave.

“Invisible Exports ............
“The economy—and the prosperity—of this King- dom depends largely upon our invisible imports and exports.” Extract from a speech.
For three successive nights the storm crashed on Matang. The sullen blackness of the night was broken only by the intermittent lightning as it lit up the solid sheet of falling rain. The rain appeared to be solid; in fact it was a million drops hammering down, minute after minute.
Some drops broke on the leaves of trees and fell in harmless spray; some dropped into streams and rivers and lost themselves there. Others smashed hard upon bare ground or upon earth tilled across the contours. At first the rain water ran clear and
pure; then a grain or two of earth was moved; grains so fine that they could hardly have been seen. As the swish of the rain became stronger, bigger specks of soil moved, then grains of sand and a small pebble or two.
The cutting power of the water increased and eroded under the side of a bank; the bank fell and was swirled away. Further down another bank splashed away and two streams joined; the clear rain water was stained a deep brown with the hurrying wealth of earth. Into the streams, then into the rivers and, since the rivers must flow to the sea, out to the hungry sea.
............ And Invisible Imports.”
“No, my good friend, no. A small child will see that such a shoe may not be worn. First you may take the shoe and cut it very nicely—so. Then you will remove ail this inside, very carefully and very nicely and you may throw it away. Next you will lay inside the shoe a thin piece of cotton wool and on this gently place each tube of opium—so, my good friend. Do this nicely and you will have sixty, seventy, eighty tubes hidden away. Now we may put the sole nicely back again, gum it round the edges so that no crack may be seen. We will take the other shoes; do not hurry my friend, there is plenty of time, there is plenty of time.
And finally we pack them nicely so that you may carry them from the ship. There is no worry now, all is invisible.”
N
On Going On Leave.
The kingfishers have returned to the garden: St. Francis alone knows where they have been these past months but now they are back and mat- ing happily in the derelict durian tree. The scarlet cannas have never shown up in such splendour and, in pledge, an errant tip of the pigeon orchid has bloomed.
The market is stocked and over slocked with fish, flesh and fowl and with vegetables enough for a rabbit colony : there is iced water to drink or iced beer if you wish it.
The landas is over and the weather cool and fresh; sufficient sun by day to ripen the laggard tomato and sufficient rain at night to swell the green cucumber.
Entertainment is there for the asking; a bridge drive, a dance and the latest film hot from Singa- pore. A theatrical troupe if it pleases you and a sunset over the Matang if it doesn’t.
Work? You can have all you want and more. If your requirements are modest, then a walk- through the offices of those who are not so moderate. You can have all the fun of the fair and hardly a penny to pay.
And yet with all this thrown in the lap, we get up and go on leave. The s.s. “Prosper” made her maiden post war trip to China well loaded with passengers. The cancellation of the sailing of the m.v. “Oranje” for the United Kingdom will have caused more heart-burnings than enough. Con- ditions may be never so good here but once the Ides of March be past, thoughts and feet turn towards home.
Currency conditions may be chaotic, inflation unchecked and prices wildly unstable, but the passenger list of the s.s. "Prosper" will show no indication of this.
Essential food coupons and luxury clothing coupons may be scarce and difficult to come by but the April sailings for the United Kingdom reflect not a scrap of it.
Ask the man who sails why he chooses April— you might just as well ask a Talmudist what aids the modesty of his marginal chetiv. He may say he likes the summer, he may well be a cricket enthusiast: it may be this, that or the other but whatever the reason, the choice is April. The winds and rains of March are only the prologue : —
" Whan Zephirus eek with his swet breeth Inspired hath in every holt and heeth The tendr cropp s, and the yong sonne Hath in the Ram his half cours y-ronne, And smal fowel s maken melodye.
That slepen al the nyght with open eye,— So priketh hem Nat re in hir cor ges.—
Thanne longen folk to goon on pilgrimages."
What’s in a Name?
I was stealthily creeping down the street the other day on my way to the Department of Poor Relations with a file of very top-secret, and frankly rather top-heavy, papers. Stealthily. I say, because I did not want to run across The Ancient and be inveigled into listening to the disgraceful stories he tells about the inebriated morons who used to govern this country. Not only does it pain me to hear such vivid tales of past debauchery but the accompanying beer, upon which he insists, is almost too weak to come out of the bottle. There is too the fact that he always contrives to throw all the aces, and has such a rude name for the game he never allows me to choose.
Picture my dismay therefore when, falling as it were between Scylla and Charybdis, I ran into that most Berkshire of boars. The Fiddler! I knew it. All attempts to emphasise the urgency of my prec ious file failed. He would take no excuses. There appeared to be some mesmerism in those innocent blue eyes of his, now rather bloodshot, and piloted by that very prominent red nose I tailed-on miser- ably behind.
“You know” he said “Wasn’t it Shakespeare or somebody who said ‘what’s in a name,’ or am I thinking about a rose smelling just as pink or something?"
I put him right. It really is amazing where they used to pick up these ignoramuses in the old days.
“Ah yes” he exclaimed brightly “but it all comes to the same thing, what?” Nothing infuriates me so much as that awful “what” at the end of all his sentences. Anyway, I rather frigidly refused a beer but The Fiddler is deaf as well as his other disabilities and I was obliged to accept a glass of that really disgusting Czechoslovakian stuff and listen to his tiresome “what! whats!!” and unpleasant anecdotes.
“I hear that the Goose Club is in a hell of a flap over the names of the new bungalows. Sort of passing files all round the place and people getting
facetious over it. Still, not a bad idea to slip a few cracks into the minutes sometimes. Sort of mild purgative, don’t yer know, saves them from getting too high-minded. Well, bung-ho!" Pick- ing up my file, which I was annoyed to see had already become fouled with beer sloppings, T enquired who the Goose Club was.
"Oh, the Goose Club. Well, that was what we used to call the Supreme Council in the old days. Rather unfair, I always thought, but nothing serious meant, what?” I said I hoped not. I strongly disapprove of misplaced levity.
“Yes, yes. I quite agree but you know what we boys were. In this case, however, I mean the Housing Committee. You know. The gents who give all the wrong houses to the right people or vice versa, as the girl said when..........” Luckily
at this point he upset my glass, and even if it is unpleasant to have Czechoslavakian beer running down the inside of your trousers it is preferable to listening to his vulgar stories.
"Mind you" he continued. “This house naming business is a bit of a buster. I mean to say, look at Claymore Cottage, for instance! I don’t really dislike the Scots, all very well at times, what?, but Claymore Cottage! Why, we’ll be having Haggis House and Tartan Towers and McIsaac Mews next."
In his vehemence he picked up my glass and downed the remains; not that there was much left as I felt the beastly stuff soaking my Robinson trousers.
“I like the old names. Yellow Bungalow was really yellow in the old days, and by the same token very rosy pink at times too.” He gave me a leering wink and swept my file on to the floor to make room for the new supply. “Montacute too. A good old name. What gives me the pip is all this Braemar and Roseneath business. By crumbs, they’ll be calling one Rus In Urbe next! And then look at Riverside Bungalow. I don’t know what it is but it always reminds me of co-respondents' shoes and those seven and sixpenny wedding rings which most jewellers slip over to von under the counter."
I really felt this was just too much and expressed neatly but firmly my distaste for such things. "Good heavens, man, you aren’t shocked, are you. what? Wouldn’t hurt your feelings for the world!" With that he thumped me on the back and to my humiliation over went my new beer all down the other leg.
“Funny, this ecclesiastical stunt. Take The Abbey, for instance. Used to know the fellow who lived there. Not at all abbot-like, as you might say. Then, by gosh, he went to The Monastery. 'Stra- ordinary thing!”
He mused awhile. I suppose he was recalling to mind his revolting friends.
“Then there’s Buckfast. I always thought it was some sort of medicinal wine which old ladies drank when they wanted to feel naughty. You know, sort of dud Wincarnis. I hear it is a whack- ing great Abbey. Can’t see the connection, can you, old boy?
A lot of lads I knew once lived at the Residency and called it Buckingham P. An awful schemozzle one night. Cars charging lamp posts. I believe there was a dame mixed up in it somewhere. Any- way, the name had to go. Quite right too. Bit unsuitable, don't yer think?”
with the droppings from his pipe. I said that I really must go now, and anyway I could see nothing wrong with such names as Beaudesert and Sanroque. To my mind they showed a cultivated and cosmo- politan outlook.
“Suffering cats!” he shouted “you can’t really mean that!” He flung my file most rudely across the bar and ordered two more to be set up. "Why, you’ll get abominations like Cosicot and Weetoo and Piggery Nook ! Once you let ’em choose for them- selves there’s no stopping 'em.
I knew a fellow who owned numbers 16 and 17 in a row of houses. He lived in 16 and let 17. However, he took part of 17 into 16 for himself and continued to let the remainder of 17. D’ye get me?” I reminded him that nowadays we did understand words of more than one syllable. “All right” he bcomed “don’t get ratty. Well, he re- numbered them 16 and 16 1/2. Bit meticulous (hic!) I thought, what?”
I noticed now that my file was smouldering from his vain attempts to light bis pipe. Silently furious I collected my sodden and singed file and got up. Blue eyes, red nose, grey hair and all the rest of his set-up, I was determined to put an end to this squalid affair.
"Well, well, old man. Suppose we must be going. Don’t forget to sign before you go out, and if you do want somebody to sit on your Goose Club I’m always at your service.”
We emerged. How the dickens I was to get back into my office with my pants like this. Besides, there was my wife to face at mid-day.
"You know, some of you blokes can be funny sometimes. I heard that one of you suggested call- ing the houses after celebrated Pubs. Usually, they went rather well, but the fellow quite rightly said it would be a trifle crude to write to Mrs. Smith, The Old Dun Cow, what?”

A Memorial.
Officers of the Old Sarawak Civil Service will be interested in the proposal to raise a suitable memorial in England to those officers who died in the service of Sarawak during the recent war.
The following invitation to subscribe towards the cost of the memorial was recently circulated in the United Kingdom.
“The suggestion has been made (and it seems to us altogether an appropriate one) that a suitable memorial should be designed to commemorate the faithfulness and courage of all those active mem- bers of the Sarawak Civil Service who gave their lives in the service of Sarawak timing the recent war. It has further been suggested that a most suitable place for such a memorial would be the. parish church of Sheepstor on Dartmoor, where the first and second Rajahs, Sir James and Sir Charles Brooke, were buried. Since Sir James Brooke initiated the great epic of Sarawak, it seems entirely appropriate that the nobility and steadfastness of those officers of the Sarawak Civil Service who sacrificed their lives in the tragic circumstances
which marked the final years of this epic should be commemorated in the same place. Preliminary inquiries have been made, and there appears to be no difficulty in the way of placing a memorial in the church at Sheepstor. This memorial might take the form of a stained-glass window of suitable design with a plaque containing the names of those who died, or it might be a bronze or stone tablet. The precise form of the memorial will partly depend on the funds which are available. In pursuance of this aim, the signatories of this letter are now writing to all those who may be interested in the project to invite subscriptions. If you are able to send a subscription, would you be willing to allow us to make all the necessary arrangements, includ- ing the selection of a memorial of suitable design? We should regard it as a great privilege to give our services in this way. and we should, of course, consult those who have expert knowledge in these matters. We should naturally inform you of the final arrangements when they have been settled, including the full details of the memorial finally selected. In the meantime, we should be glad to consider any suggestions which you might like to make.
Subscriptions should be sent to :

The “Box.”
Ex-internees will doubtless be interested to hear the results of a collection which was taken immediately upon the liberation at Batu Lintang Camp, in order to provide some suitable recognition to those men whose magnificent work kept the camp supplied with news almost continuously throughout the Occupation.
The scheme originated in the British Officers’ Camp, and a committee was set up under the chair- manship of Lieut. Perry, with F/Lt. Lee, Capt. MacArthur and Lieut. Wilson to assist, and this committee has just made public its final decisions.
A collection was taken on the spot, mainly by cheques and promises to pay, and no less than £541.13.4d was eventually realised from the British Officers, and £241.8.8d from the Australian Officers.
The Committee obtained from Lieut. Sunderland aud F/Lt. Fleming (both at the time Warrant Officers in charge of the Other Ranks Camp) a detailed picture of the wireless’ operation and main- tenance after the departure of the officers in January, 1943, and this was used as a basis for the allocation of awards, which were made as under :—
Mementoes in Silver :
£25 Lieut. Sunderland
£20 W/O. Beckett, Sgt. Miles, Sgt. Pep- ler, F/Lt. Fleming, Ong Tiang Swee Esquire
£10 Cpl. Pringle, S/M. Scott, S/Sgt. Hardie, S/M. Southern and Driver Martin
Monetary Award :
£35 Sgt. Pepler
After disbursal of the above 73% of the remaining moneys to be banded to W/O. Beckett and 27% to Sgt. Miles.
Due to inevitable delays of post-war manufacture of the suitably inscribed silver beer tankards which were decided upon as the mementoes and to the time lag in corresponding with Australia, and collecting the Australian Officers’ contributions, the Fund was finally not wound up until 10th April, 1947.
Very grateful letters of thanks have been received from the recipients of all awards, and the Com- mittee has expressed its most sincere thanks to all contributors for their magnificent response. Official recognition has also been forthcoming as W/O. Beckett was awarded the B.E.M. (Military Divis- ion) and F/Lt. Fleming a Mention in Despatches for their share in the operation and maintenance of the "box.” Beckett is now working in a govern- ment sponsored Short-wave Research Establishment in the South of England.

The “box” was the P.O.W. and Internees’ name for the wireless set constructed by Warrant Officer Beckett in camp, and formed a complete unit which was contained in a regulation size Army mess tin. The Japanese were fairly certain of the existence of such a set but numerous searches by them failed to reveal its ingenious hiding place which was known to half a dozen men only out of the two thousand men in the Camp until after the Liberat- ion.—(Contributed.)
Sarawak Museum.
The following exhibits have now been placed in the Sarawak Museum :—
1.
The State Sword of Sarawak borne before the Rajahs of Sarawak on great State occas- ions. In 1917 the Third Rajah took the oath on this sword, which was carried by the Tuan Muda. It was last used on 14th April, 1946, when the Rajah landed in Kuching after the recapture of his State. It was carried by the Datu Temonggong.
2.
A Sword inscribed “John Channon from the Raja. 1864.” Captain Channon (1852-1868) was in command of H.H. Gunboat “Heart- sease” and served in many engagements against Dayak and Malay pirates.
The Tuan Muda in 1859 wrote of Captain Channon “his valuable services, as well as steady and brave conduct, both on board and in the jungles, cannot be too highly praised in the annals of Sarawak.”
3.
Two old pattern Civil Service Swords.
4.
Japanese Sword presented to the Rajah by Brigadier Eastick, d.s.o., e.d., Commander of the Force which relieved Kuching.
5.
A Sword of the Royal Field Artillery worn by the Tuan Muda, Captain Bertram Brooke.
6.
An old pattern Sarawak Civil Service uniform (including cocked hat) worn by the present Rajah.
These exhibits, with explanatory labels, are on show in two special cases.
Films of the Month.
The outstanding film of the month was shown under the title of "How a Bicycle is Made.”
It was not an outstandingly good film it was an outstandingly bad one; shown by courtesy of the Sarawak Government, the intention was that the film should be a general interest “short” show- ing the various phases in the manufacture of a bicycle, and presumably intended to illustrate “Buy British” or “British is best.” Instead of achieving this praiseworthy object it simply succeed- ed in illustrating how appallingly bad British pro- paganda can be.
A week or so later, there was an effective contrast in another short film “The Big City.” It depicted various activities and scenes in Greater London and would give to Sarawak audiences a fair idea of what the capital city of the Empire looks like and how the people there live.
In the middle of the month, Frankenstein was resurrected twice nightly under the title of “The House of Frankenstein.” Gentle Mary Shelly could never have visualised the crudities to which her fantasy would, in this film, be degraded and her bones must have turned no less wearily than those of her creation, Frankenstein. When the film was originally made it is difficult to guess, but Lon Chaney, who played a leading role, has been dead for many years now. Whoever produced this film released a crude monstrosity whose only virtue was that it had been severely cut.

News from Far and Near.
FIRST DIVISION.
The Honourable the Resident, First Division, (Mr. Morse) reports that in a recent case of selling above controlled prices, which came before the Resident's Court on appeal, the excuse given was that the profit was for the benefit of the local school. The accused appeared to be astonished when he found that this excuse was not acceptable to the Court.
Commenting upon the output of gold from mines in the Bau area (which in February totalled 30.427 ounces) the Honourable the Resident writes that the output is pathetic when one remembers that, if all mines were in full production, the figure would be somewhere between twelve and fifteen hundred ounces.
The District Officer, Kuching, (Mr. Outram) comments that gambling cases figured prominently in the District Court during February. Other cases before Courts were those in contravention of Immigration, Traffic and Arrack-manufacturing laws. No serious crime was reported during the month.
The District Officer, Kuching, reports that prices of most commodities continued to rise during February. Shortage of rubber due to the wet weather caused something of a depression in Kuching, though trade was naturally brisk over Chinese New Year and the number of crackers sold was almost up to pre-war level.
The District Officer, Bau, (Mr. Lloyd Thomas) reports that “For most of the month the jail was empty, which, it seems probable, is a hitherto unrecorded state of affairs in Bau.”
The following is an extract from the report of the District Officer, Bau. “There was further dissension between the Christians and non-Christ- ians in Senggi, the former apparently having taken to disposing of their and their non-Christian relatives’ pesaka, notably tawak-tawak, on the grounds that, as these things were only wanted for the adat, the Christians did not want them. Numerous cases of this sort of thing have been traced and where the property clearly belonged to people other than those disposing of it, action has been taken.”
The District Officer, Bau, reports that trade was undoubtedly brisker than for a long time, at the beginning of the month, but this mild “boom” was a purely artificial and temporary one due to general increased spending in connection with Chinese New Year. A large percentage of dealers took advantage of the custom-enforced spending by Chinese custom- ers at the time to indulge in profiteering by means of price raises. Another practice adopted by many local dealers at the end of the month was that of not drawing ration rice but of importing small quan- tities of local rice from Kuching at intervals, thereby keeping the supply short and the price high ($1.80 to $2.00 a gantang as against $1.30 to $1.40 report- ed from Kuching). It is increasingly clear that drastic action is required to combat this profiteering.
The District Officer, Bau, reports “The bridge at Tanjong Durian previously reported stolen was replaced by a temporary structure pending settle- ment of negotiation for the purchase of bilian. On one occasion I took a plank bridge with me on the jeep to enable a passage at this point.”
The following is an extract from the report of the District Officer, Serian (Mr. Roberts). “On 29th February a Chinese lad aged 22 years commit- ted suicide at Tebakang, using a shot gun. He had been scolded by his father for incurring a gambling debt of some $20.”
SECOND DIVISION.
The Honourable the Resident, Second Division, (Mr. Ditmas) gives an interesting account in bis February report of the opening of the new fort at Lubok Antu. After a description of the ceremony and of the building itself, the Resident adds “The Ulu Ai Dayaks appear to be really impressed with the new station and grateful to Government for building such a fine one. That His Excellency the Governor himself should open the station was very greatly appreciated, and I know that the name Fort Arundell, in memory of the late Mr. G. R. H. Arundell, which was given at the request of many of the Ulu Ai themselves, will not only be appreciated by the Ulu Ai and Second Division, but I am sure by the whole of Sarawak.”
To complete the description of the fort, the Resident attached an illustrated supplement to his report which gives an excellent idea of the pleasing appearance of the new building.
The following is an extract from the report of the Acting District Officer, Simanggang, (Mr. Bruen) : “In Engkilili the Chinese proprietor of the m.v. “Hai Ping” was charged with a breach of the Movement Control Regulations and with assault. The Court was not satisfied that the accused’s gesticulations when he saw his tobacco, for which he had no permit to ship, being put ashore were tantamount to assault. It was pro- bably a case of the natural reaction of the frustration of one who nearly, but not quite, succeeds in evading the law. The accused was convicted on the one charge and fined.”
The Acting District Officer, Simanggang, reports : “In Lingga ‘the nightsoil was carried out with satisfaction.’ ”
The following is an extract from the report of the Acting District Officer, Simanggang : “A written complaint was received, signed by several tuai-tuai rumah against Penghulu Ganieng, one of the new penghulus in the Ulu Lingga. These tuai-tuai rumah complained of the new penghulu’s general incompetency and suggested that another one be chosen from the signatories of this com- plaint. Upon investigation it appeared that no grounds for complaint existed and that the leader of these unsatisfied tuai-tuai rumah had had this complaint written for him and had canvassed a few signatures from other tuai-tuai rumah, and was of the opinion that he himself would make an excel- lent penghulu. This opinion of himself was quickly dispelled and he was soundly rated. The other signatories were, in point of fact, all quite satisfied with the penghulu—they themselves had elected him only a short time ago.”
The Simanggang Recreation Club has now been extensively repaired and decorated.
The following is the conclusion to the February report of the Acting District Officer, Simanggang: “There has been considerable speculation and uneasiness recently concerning Buck Ryan, who in his exploits in the “Daily Mirror” has now reached Sarawak in pursuance of his search for smuggled hornbill features. It is feared that this famous detective might get to hear of the smuggling activities, so prevalent on the nearby Dutch border, and arrive in Simanggang on any bore now. It is doubtful if he will be offered drinks to the boom of a tawak and the shout of "Boy! Booze Dis- pense!”. but he will be received and entertained spiritedly."
The Acting District Officer, Saribas, (Mr. Waine) reports that, with the recent drop in the price of sago and rubber. the people of Pusa are beginning to realise the wisdom of planting sufficient padi to meet their needs.
The Tua Rumah of Jungkal has been admitted to hospital suffering from a poisoned foot caused, lie states, by stepping on some snake bones some two months previously.
The Acting District Officer, Saratok, (Mr. Wil- son) reports a Court case in which Pengarah anak Anding was found not guilty of causing hurt to one Rajau anak Beji by negligently wounding him with buckshot during a pig shoot.
The wounded Rajau created a great stir when he arrived in Court on a stretcher and asked that he might be lifted onto the Court table as his voice was failing. He was not, however, too sick to walk twelve miles back to Rohan after the case.
THIRD DIVISION.
During the tour of the Lower Rejang District, the Honourable the Resident, Third Division, (Mr. Barcroft) declared officially open the new Govern- ment Offices at Binatang. The Honourable the Resident commented that remarkably few requests were brought to his notice during the tour, which ended at Sarikei on the 24th February , and that the people whom he met appeared prosperous, happy and contented.
The District Officer, Sibu, (Mr. Fisher) reports that there have been several convictions under the Monopolies Order of people dealing in illicit arrack, and that it appears likely that more such cases will come before the Courts.
The District Officer, Sibu, includes in his report an account of the tour of the Cadet Officer and the Dayak Native Officer of Kampong Igan and the Lower Igan from which the following is extracted. “Kampong Igan is still split in every aspect of its daily life into pro-cession and anti-cession parties, though neither side seems very energetic except in the matter of discrediting the other. The pro- cession element badly wants a school, partly to pre- vent the children running wild and partly to be able to score over the Anti-cessionists by pointing to con- crete results of the benefits of Colonial rule.
“It was surprising to note how long it took some women to remember how many children they had had, and discussions on this matter sometimes be- came quite acrimonious,
“Practically all houses wanted a photo of His Majesty the King, especially if coloured and free. They all stated they wanted a Union Jack to put up when His Excellency the Governor should visit them. The recent picture of H.R.H. Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh caused great interest and admiration. The Duke seems to have won the hearts of the Melanos and Davaks.
“The Cadet Officer also visited a Melano (?) monolith at the junction of Sungei Retus and Batang Igan, and standing in a swamp about thirty yards in amongst the trees. It is a belian post of about thirty feet high and between two feet six inches and three feet in diameter. It is now deteriorating badly. It is in an area quite free of belian and must have been very heavy to raise up. It is greatly respected by the Melanos who say their great chief Tugau erected it there over 200 years ago. Passing Mela- nos and Dayaks put money in the trunk and state that anyone so sacrilegious as to remove this money would certainly die. It appears there is an even bigger belian monolith a little inland from the one visited.”
The following is an extract from the report of the District Officer, Sibu. “It was considered that the sense of pride in the appearance of Sibu, by the residents thereof, was getting slack. In January a 'blitz' occurred and Sibu town's appear- ance has altered materially for the better though there is still a long way to go before the civic situat- ion can be considered satisfactory. The new market has been opened and many stall holders have been moved off the street into it. It is hoped to have all stall holders' barrows off the streets in the near future. As if by magic many roofs are appearing resplendent in their new red tiles. The areas in front of Old Street and around the old bombed mar- ket are being cleared up. A fine view up the Rejang can now be had from Old Street. It is hoped to be able to convert the old market into a modern bus terminus.”
The District Officer, Sibu. reports that all the schools seemed to swop over teachers with one another for the New Year. This is a strange habit but an all too frequent one. It cannot be good for the school management or the pupils.
After eleven weeks of hard work, the Bomb Dis- posal Squad has finished work in Sibu. The District Officer comments that they have done grand work in raising and destroying bombs mostly in the airfield but also in the bazaar.
The following is an extract from the report of the District Officer, Lower Rejang (Mr. Snelus). “The pepper garden at the 3rd mile Repok Road maintains good progress and should encourage other pre-war planters in the district to try their luck again. Provided the market price does not drop, this praiseworthy effort should reap its due reward in another year’s time, when the more advanced of the 800 vines now planted by this enterprising gardener will attain maturity.
“Many other ex-pepper planters of the Can- tonese community have, however, now applied for a combined total of between 2,000 and 3,000 acres of land on the opposite bank of the Batang Re- jang to Sarikei for the purpose of planting padi, sa- go, derries root and other crops. They have also kapok and hemp in mind should the Agricultural Department find that the land in question is suit- able for such crops. But the situation is complicat- ed by the fact that the areas applied for are within a Native Reserve.”
The District Officer, Dower Rejang, reports that at the conclusion of the ceremony of opening the new Government Offices at Binatang, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce provided refreshments which was "a much appreciated gesture on the part of the local Chinese to show their pleasure and pride in the new symbol of Binatang’s progress.”
The District Officer, Kanowit (Mr. Drake), com- menting on the Census returns for the Kanowit district, reports "The Kanowits were reduced from their 1939 total of 188 to a mere 115. This was partly a result of an epidemic in 1944 which carried oil about 30, and partly due to their intemperate ha- bits. Men and women spend all their money on arrack, and, as a consequence, the birth rate is very low. It is to be feared that, before very long, they will die out completely."
The District Officer, Kanowit, reports that a case for defamation was heard in Kanowit before the District Officer, Lower Rejang, in which the complainants entirely failed to prove their ease. The District Officer adds “Throughout the case, the Prosecutor was continually trying to tell the Court how the ease should be held. After a very patient hearing, the Magistrate finally threw the case out when the Prosecutor alleged that the case was being improperly conducted.”
It is hoped to open a cinema at Kanowit during February.
The Assistant District Officer, Kapit, (Mr. Rennick) reports a case of attempted theft from a Dayak grave, the principal offender being sentenced to six months imprisonment and a fine of $30. Local rumours attribute losses in the padi crops, which had been heavily infested with pests, to this tampering with a grave.
FOURTH DIVISION.
The Honourable the Resident, Fourth Division; (Mr. Gilbert) reports that the rehabilitation of the Miri bazaar is delayed by technical difficulties at the brick works. The Resident comments that gas is the obvious means of firing the kilns if that can be arranged.
The following is an extract from the report of the District Officer, Miri (Mr. Lascelles). “On New Year’s night a Malay, Abdul Hamid, S.O.L. ferry driver, stabbed and killed a 19 year old Malay girl living in the same lines at Sungei Merbau. He escaped and was captured by workmen on the 3rd, between Lutong and Kuala Baram. His defence that he did it while suffering from a nightmare was
rejected at bis trial in the Miri Resident’s Court, and on 15th he was sentenced to death. He appealed to the Supreme Court but his appeal was dismissed.
Last year Mat Aseng. a Mohammedan Chinese, performing the same ferry driving task as Abdul Hamid, went amok, killed eight persons and wounded four others. The Abdul Hamid killing immediately gave rise to a feeling, among the Malays, that the Company ferry was possessed of some evil spirit, and it was decided, that in order to prevent further troubles descending on the ferry crews, action should be taken. Accordingly on the 18th a ‘cleansing’ ceremony took place, with S.O.L. permission, the ferry was stopped for about half an hour in mid-stream and all the ferry crew shifts partook of a makan salamat, “BURU BALA,” on the ferry and various prayers were recited.”
On the 21st January a big haul of equipment for distilling illicit arrack was made at Pujut. More men were engaged there than were employed by the holder of the Government Monopoly.
The District Officer, Miri, reports that on the 23rd January the Young Malay Association cele- brated Mohamad’s birthday at the Mosque. The Persekutuan Melayu. not to be outdone, put on a three night play on the badminton pitch about 150 yards away. The Young Malay Association having a loudspeaker and microphone possessed rather an advantage.
The District Officer, Miri, reports that the Municipal dog catcher, paid on results only, is making a good start, averaging two or three a day but there still remains a large number of hairless, ownerless animals which have to be liquidated.
A tragedy occurred on the Miri bar in January. The water was too low for the S.O.L. mooring crew to use a launch to cross the bar, so they proceeded to the inside edge of the bar in one launch and transferred to a prahu in order to cross the bar and embark on the other mooring launch waiting outside the bar. While crossing the bar the prahu was struck by an extra large wave and sank. Of the occupants, sixteen Malays and one European, five Malays were drowned and one body has not yet been recovered.
Apparently there was a very strong tide running out at the time; those who allowed themselves to go with the tide were picked up by fishing boats just about to cross the bar; the drowned were those who lost their heads and tried to fight against the current. The Honourable the Resident later reported that a verdict of death by misadventure was passed.
The District Officer, Bintulu, (Mr. Drake-Brock- man) reports that the prices offered by local traders for jungle produce remained sufficiently high to induce natives to go on working belian attaps, timbers, damar and jelutong.
Although the price of raw sago has gone down considerably it still provided some employment for the Melanaus in the kampongs, especially those who have their own sago palms to work.
The District Officer, Bintulu, reports a drop during the month of January in the prices of rice, poultry and coconuts.
FIFTH DIVISION.
The Honourable the Resident, Fifth Division, (Mr. Anderson) reports that a very successful Children’s Party was held at the Residency in January. The more enterprising element amongst the small boys worked a racket for exploiting the bran tub at the expense of the less acquisitive guests but this was controlled by the host who sat on the bran tub until the juvenile go-getters retired.
During an intensive tour of inspection by a visiting party of cocoa experts, the party remarked on the thinness of the population in the fertile Sundar/Trusan valley. The Honourable the Resi- dent comments that the probable reasons are the comparative inaccessibility of the area, the policy of protecting native rights against indiscriminate immigration and exploitation and possibly the former lack of medical and health facilities.
An application was received for a license to export a large quantity of mangrove firewood direct to China but the proposal was rejected.
The following is an extract from the monthly report of the Cadet Officer, Limbang, (Mr. Harper) “A fair number of upriver people have come down to Limbang during the month including a party of Kelabits carrying mail and census material from Mr. T. Harrisson. This party arrived on 29th having left Mr. Harrisson about 11th December, the excessive time taken being due to the instruct- ions issued by Mr. Harrisson that they were not to take the more normal route via Lawas but to come by the far more difficult paths to the Ulu Limbang.” The Honourable the Resident com- ments that Mr. Harrisson was probably right in sending the party down the Limbang as unfortun- ately there is still a danger of reprisals against Kelabits owing to the Lupin murder.
The Cadet Officer, Limbang. reports that no anti-cession activities were observed during the month.
It is reported from Limbang that a prisoner, serving a sentence for theft of a gun, applied for “leave” to harvest his padi. This request was refused, but it is gratifying to observe that the Government’s “grow more padi” campaign has borne some fruit.
The Assistant District Officer, Lawas, (Mr. Smith) reports “The Lawas bazaar presents a dismal appearance when compared with the pros- perous and well-stocked bazaar at Labuan. This is due mainly to the fact that goods exported from Labuan to Lawas are twice liable to duty and in many cases this puts up the price to such an extent that the goods would not be saleable here.” The Honourable the Resident comments that the dismal appearance of the Lawas bazaar cannot be wholly due to these reasons, because the adverse conditions of double duty apply as a rule to Limbang bazaar also and it appears to be flourishing. Apparently the traders cannot or will not import on through hills of lading.
CORRESPONDENCE.
THE MURUTS.
Bareo, January 21st, 1948.
The Editor, Sarawak Gazette, Kuching.
Sir,
The excellent and comprehensive report on the Muruts which was published in the December, 1947, issue of the “Sarawak Gazette” has again focussed attention on the Murut and Kelabit peoples about whom so much has been written during the past year. It is a fortunate circumstance that these fine people should have, at this stage of their develop- ment, the sympathetic administration and interest of the Resident, Fifth Division, and Mr. Tom Harrisson. It is in full appreciation of this fact that I feel compelled to correct an impression created by the editorial insertion of Mr. Harrisson's comments in the published extracts from the Resident’s Report. I refer to the suggested need to revive ancient arts and crafts, and the supposed danger to native culture upon conversion to Christ- ianity.
On this present journey I have again verified that neither songs nor dances nor any ancient arts and crafts have been lost or discouraged through the conversion of the Muruts to Christianity. It is a fact, acknowledged by the Muruts themselves, that within living memory the only songs and dances known to them were those associated with head- taking, and these ceased to be practised under government control; although I understand that until their conversion occasional murders were celebrated by a head feast held secretly a year or so later. Other songs and dances, still common among neighbouring tribes, and much of their truly ancient tribal culture had before this become sub- merged in a morass of drunken degradation.
It was under such depressing circumstances, well- known to all who knew the Muruts in the old days, that certain arts and crafts deteriorated, and their conversion to Christianity has in fact encouraged these very desirable parts of native life. All through the vast Murut hinterland (and in speaking of Muruts we must ignore international boundaries) certain arts and crafts are specialised in different localities. For instance the Muruts at Brayong still have a thriving rotan lampit mat industry, and they also make the excellent “kelapit” rotan baskets which are their speciality. Again, the Murut women’s sun hat is something which is unrivalled by the sun hats of either Tagals or Kelabits. They still make parangs, padi baskets, mats, and during the cloth shortage, their bark coats, and in certain Murut localities they have vigorously revived the art of weaving. Under the pressure of modern influences the pattern of native life and culture is bound to change, whether as a result of Christian teaching or of increasing contact with coastal influ- ences. Indeed the change to wearing shorts and cutting the hair had begun among the Muruts long before the advent of the mission.
We are very conscious of the dangers incidental to the abandonment of pagan superstitions and practices, and the need for intimate knowledge of the customs and culture of the people who look to us for spiritual guidance, and we are glad of all constructive suggestions that may help to this end. It is in this spirit that we approach the profound changes that have already taken place on the Kelabit plateau and those now being initiated among the Kayans and Kenyas on the Akah and Baram.
This is being written at Bareo in the heart of the Kelabit country where with my wife we have had most helpful and constructive discussions with Mr. Tom Harrisson concerning these vital problems.
Yours faithfully,
C. H. Southwell.
The Editor,
Sarawak Gazette,
Kuching.
Sir,
Mr. Southwell has shown me his letter, with which I am in sympathy. I had a mind to issue a caveat about rapid changes in adat, mainly with reference to the Kelabits, about whom I know a certain amount. Now that I have had the pleasure of a talk on the spot, I believe constructive results may indeed follow. And I have been impressed by the sincere work and devotion of this Mission here.
Tom Harrisson.
THE MUSEUM.
Kuching,
10th March, 1948. The Editor,
Sarawak Gazette,
Kuching.
Dear Sir,
For some time past I have been trying to get together a collection of pre-cession Government buttons, badges and other marks of rank for display at the Sarawak Museum.
There are probably numbers of these, going back many years, in the possession of Government Departments, members of the Government Service, past and present, and the general public. I appeal to those Departments or individuals to send me one, or preferably two, specimens of each button or badge.
I do not offer to purchase these as I feel that, not only have they no real monetary value, but people would like to present them to the Museum in order to remind future generations of the hundred years of Brooke rule.
Thank you, Mr. Editor, for making space for this letter: lately I have been using much more of it than my pen warrants.
Yours faithfully,
J. B. Archer.
THE AMERICAN MARKET.
The Editor,
Sarawak Gazette, Kuching,
Kuching. 22nd March, 1948.
Sir,
I would like to draw the attention of your readers to an open letter addressed to packers and shippers of crude rubber to America, which appeared in the “Straits Times” of 4th March, 1948. It warns Singapore and Malayan shippers that unless grading and packing are improved at the earliest opportunity they are apt to be faced with heavy claims and rejections of their tenders.
A reply to this open letter made by Mr. F. S. Thomson of North Hummock Estate, Klang, appeared in the Straits Times of 9th March, 1948. Rubber producers in this country will certainly endorse the “crude facts” as stated in Mr. Thomp- son’s letter. Speaking of Malaya, Mr. Thompson said. "It is quite safe to say that the Asiatic small holder is now producing at subsistence level and no more, and that no natural rubber producing com- pany could show a return in the last ten years of more than 2 1/2% on capital invested.”
If what Mr. Hummock said is true of Malayan rubber producers (and we have no doubt that it is), with its better stand of rubber and its more advantageous situation in the rubber market, the lot of the poor producers in this colony is infinitely worse. We have to pay an additional $2.00 in freight, l%-2% agent’s commission, and about double to what the Malayan producers have to pay in custom export duty. Rubber producers are only able to carry on at the expense of a very low standard of living and by virtue of the fact that to the bulk of native producers rubber is only a side line to padi cultivation.
There is growing resentment among those who have direct dealings with America. Shippers of rubber to America maintain that American buyers are expecting very much higher grading than pre-war. The same rubber which buyers in Europe or in other places would accept readily would if sent to America involve the shipper in claims. Unfortunately, the quantities of rubber which other countries can take is small, so that the Ameri- can buyer is not faced with a bit of healthy com- petition. Another fact is that whereas prewar the difference in price between RSS 1 and RSS 4 is only 1 1/2 cents per lb. the difference is now 4 1/2 cents per lb. This very much wider difference puts the buyer in a very advantageous position as huge claims can be made on the shipper if shipment is off the standard expected.
Finally, it has often been stated that as far as the manufacturers are concerned it matters little whether the rubber is RSS 1 or RSS 4 as on arrival at the factory the rubber goes into a huge cauldron with hesian, packing chests and all! All the fine grading is designed to put estates owned by big rubber interests in a position to compete with the small native producers. If that statement is true then all this talk of grading, packing and claims is just so much eye-wash.
Yours, etc.,
Ong Kee Hui, C/o Bian Chiang Bank,

From "Adversity": Internment Quarterly.
(The following verse was published in "Adversity" on First of January, 1944.)
INTERCESSION.
Inoffensive people— Wand’ring aimlessly, Fearing criticism, Living blamelessly, Loving platitudes and Siding with the crowd, Simulating heartiness Lest one think them proud,— Holding no opinions Save what others air, Always damn good fellows, Welcome everywhere.
God, forgive them! Not a spark Of what makes Life supreme, Devotion to a purpose,— Realization of a dream.
