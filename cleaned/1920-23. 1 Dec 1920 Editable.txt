Report on the survey of the
Baram River.
? I received instructions from His Highness the Rajah to accompany Major J. C. Moulton and Professor H. W. Smith who proposed to visit the Kalabit country with the object of making collections for the Singapore and Boston Museums. My instructions were to survey the district visited as far as possible in the lime available.
It was never intended to attempt anything in the nature of an accurate survey which would not have been possible under the circumstances, but I hoped with the help of Professor Smith who brought with him a portable wireless outfit supplied by the Western Electric Company of America to obtain frequent astronomical checks on the work.
Professor Smith had also ordered from Messrs. Bar & Stroud a portable range finder which would have been of great value had it arrived in time. Unfortunately the weather was so consistently bad that it was seldom possible to get star observations and time signals were only heard at Marudi (Baram) and Leo Matu. The positions of these two places have consequently been fixed astronomically, but at no other place were reliable observations for longitude obtained as the watch (kindly lent to Major Moulton by the Royal Geographical Society) was unaccountably erratic in its rate and could not be relied on.
Sketches of the river were made on the way up from Baram mouth to Leo Matu on a scale of 40 chains to an inch. These were unfortunately lost by the capsizing of the boat in which Captain Gifford (who accompanied our party as far as Leo Matu) was returning to Kuching. Fresh surveys were however made on the return journey.
From Leo Matu I was able to fix the position of a point on Mount Tudan from which I obtained bearings on some of the surrounding hills. Thereafter I accompanied Major Moulton up the Selungo stream to the foot of Murud mountain which I climbed with the object of obtaining more bearings.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, DECEMBER 1, 1920.
I spent three days on this mountain in a vain attempt to get sights and had eventually to return owing to shortage of food.
On arrival at Leo Matu I learned that Major Moulton was suffering from malarial fever and intended returning via the Akar river, and Professor Smith and myself decided to return to Long Aka to await him there.
I had intended climbing other hills in the vicinity of Leo Matu to obtain more bearings but stocks of rice were almost finished and it was found impossible to obtain more than a small quantity locally. I had consequently no alternative but to return at once.
The journey from Baram to Leo Matu occupied 22 days instead of eleven as anticipated it being impossible to ascend beyond certain points with the river in flood as was too frequently the case.
The expedition was a failure from every point of view and the river survey would have been of no more value than the existing surveys had it not been for the wireless apparatus brought by Professor Smith with the help of which we were enabled to fix the Longitude of Baram and Leo Matu.
Professor Smith spent much time and patience erecting the wireless apparatus at every convenient and inconvenient spot we visited and it must have been a disappointment to him not hearing the time signals once on the way up-river. The signals from Cavite were however distinctly audible at Leo Matu
on two occasions and at Baram once. At Baram on our return from Leo Matu the aerial was attached to a higher tree than before and the Hong Kong time signals were clearly audible every night but those from Cavite were only heard once.
The longitude of Marudi is 7 hours 37 minutes
and 21 seconds east of Greenwich and that of Leo
Matu 7 hours 40 minutes and 53 seconds.
At Baram, Long Aka and Leo Matu, I was able to fix the latitude by circummeridianal observations of the sun but at other places the probable error of the results obtained is greater, as the sun's meridian
altitude only was observed, and star observations were seldom possible owing to the persistently bad
weather conditions. The wireless receiving outfit which was supplied by the Western Electric Com-pany of America has been kindly lent by Professor
Smith for the use of the Survey Department and will doubtless be of great value in making the pre-liminary-survey of the country which is now so badly needed.
It will be readily understood that the proper co-ordination of the work could not be undertaken in the field and consequently the finished plans are not
yet available but these will be submitted to you when completed in the course of a few days.
I wish to record my thanks for the invaluable help which I received from Professor Smith and also from the District Officer Mr. C D. Adams without whose assistance it would have been impossible to obtain boats and men for the expedition. Mr. Adams accompanied us as far as Long Aka and the arrangements that he had made to ensure the success of the expedition were perfect, and had the weather conditions been more favourable there is no doubt that the original plans would have been followed without any hitch.

Supt. Lands and Surveys.
SIMANGGANG.
October.
Enna of Gunggang's house, Guntong. Undup, was brought down on the 8th. for the attempted murder of his wife Demit and her paramour Ubam. Mr. W. F. Dick left for the Undup accompanied by P. S. Jinggan early next morning to investigate, returning the following day. Though Demit and Ubam both bear very severe wounds, it is not expected these will prove fatal, and further proceedings have been adjourned for their recovery.
Mr H. H. Kortright, D. O. Sadong. accompanied by Mr. E. H Haldane, arrived here by boat on the 10th.; and the latter left for Kabong on the 12th.
Abang Dul left for the Saribas the same day to look into some cases before my arrival, accompanied by Penghulu Kana of the Ulu Ai who had arrived three days previously from Lubok Antu.
Saribas.--- I left for Betong with Mr. Kortright, who was on short leave, on the 13th., and was there for five days. A large number of cases came up for hearing, including several intricate disputes over sago and fanning lands. Taie (Malay) was sentenced to one year imprisonment and a fine for indecent assault on a married woman on their farm.
Insor, Tansang Dayak, was sentenced to six months imprisonment for contempt of Court. At the instigation of this Tuai-rumah, the people of his house had deliberately gone over the boundary in land case originally settled thirteen years ago, the boundary then laid down by the late Pengarah. Penghulu Biju and other chiefs having been upheld in later cases before Mr. H. L. Owen, the late Mr. D. J. S. Bailey. Mr. O. Lang and Mr. A. B. Ward. Securities of 100 deposited pending this last re-examination were returned. It is hoped this will be a salutary lesson as to the inadvisability of even the richest Dayaks attempting to upset long-standing decisions of the Courts. Gapar (Lubok Antu) Malay, was sentenced to 2 years R. I. for the theft
of $600 in cash and jewellery from a Dayak house at Dabok. Haji Ali of Serembang was heavily lined for laying claim to, and restraining Dayaks from felling old jungle for sago gardens. This was a most typical instance of the "dog in the manger" tactics of the present-day Saribas Malay. Asit, a
Dabok Dayak, ingenuously added his own name on a pass issued to two others to proceed to Balingian. The writing was a very fair imitation of the clerks. Asits excuse being that he had not got the time to apply in person, he was informed he would get this in default of the fine imposed. An appeal which had been lodged at the time against the decision of the Belong Court last year in re Libus; Nyelang was heard before a full Court of N. O.s and Penghulus, and finally dismissed.
We left Betong on the 17th at mid-day, stopping at Seruai for the tide, and reached Pusa at 3 a. m. The s. s. Alice Lorraine arrived from Kuching the same morning. Court was held on the 18th. and 19th., the only case of importance being an appeal against the decision of the Pusa Court in September in re Achek vs: Kechik which was reversed, the fine and fees imposed being returned to the appellant. Arrangements were made for the supply of bilian wood and attaps the new Court house at Debak, sanctioned by His Highness the Rajah.
I took passage by s. s. Alice Lorraine to Kuching on the evening of the 19th. accompanied by Mr. Kortright, and Mr. Ha who had arrived from Kabong that afternoon, and was there for six days undergoing further medical treatment for dysentery.
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, DECEMBER 1, 1920.
261
Kalaka.I retained to Kabong on the 27th. by the s s. Alice Lorraine, accompanied by Abang Dul; Penghulu Kana arrived there from Pusa the previous day.
Three Chinese, suspected to be escaped prisoners or absconding from Sibu were sent back there in custody on the 29th. P. C. Mentol, Kabong, was dismissed the force, and sentenced to one year imprisonment for theft of, and selling, Government padi stocks.
Owing to the condition in which I found the Kalaka accounts I found it advisable to temporarily suspend the former Court Writer, Sim Chin Kaw, who is now stationed at Belong. Mr. Dick proceeded there from Simanggang on the 31st., taking Entering to act there, pending an official enquiry into the allegations against Sim Chin Kaw. which will be held on my return to Simanggang next month.
I am reporting on this matter under separate cover; and, though 1 am not as yet convinced of actually deliberate dishonesty on his part, there is no doubt Sim Chin Kaws conduct in attending to his duties in the station is worthy of the most seven- censure and that he is liable to refund a considerable amount of Government revenue lost on this account, but which, I fear, cannot be accurately estimated till the accounts have been thoroughly audited. I trust it will be found possible to effect this in the near future, also the accounts of the rest of the Division, which, as already reported, have not been audited since the beginning of 1918.
A petition signed by certain Kabong, Roban and Saratok Chinese for permission to lie granted to Chua Beng Tek to return to the Kalaka was presented to me. Chua Beng Tek absconded in May after the litigation mentioned in the April report.
The petition was forwarded to Kuching for the consideration of His Highness the Rajah's Deputies.
One Chua Ma Gi was severely fined for keeping frandulent accounts.
The Government Malay School at Kabong. established in June, I was glad to find progressing very well. There are now over 60 attendants while at Saratok there are nearly 50 applicants, the actual opening of the school awaiting the arrival of the teacher, who has now been engaged.
We left for Roban on the 30th. arriving there the same evening. Court was held next morning, but there were no cases of importance. I arranged for the supply of bilian wood and attaps required for the extensions to the present Court house, which have been sanctioned by His Highness the Rajah. A school has been started here by the local Chinese and shows good progress. Should the numbers increase I consider this is worthy of Government assistance.
On the 31st. a Chinaman returning from his garden to the bazaar, somewhat inebriated, met his death by drowning through the capsizing of his boat in the main river.
Court - At Simanggang, before I left for the Sari- bas and Kalaka, there were the usual number of cases : the following may be mentionedChin Fatt (Marup) and Liew Siew (Braiyun), pepper planters, each sentenced to 3 months imprisonment for fraudulent breach of contract. Tai lie (Sadong) sentenced to 6 months imprisonment for obtaining advances under false pretences.
Several Engkilili Chinese were prosecuted and fined for trading without licenses and proceeding to Merakai, N. I., without passes.
An appeal lodged by Tuanku Bujang against the decision of the Native Court was dismissed.
P. W. D.Mr. W. F. Dick in my absence reports that the extension of the Resident's Office has been
completed, likewise the cementing below the hospital and of the Dispensary and operating theatre. This latter building is now practically finished but for certain fittings long over-due from Kuching, and some bilian planking which has been obtained in the Krian.
The following are the trade returns for the Division, with the exception of Pusa, the Court Writer of that station being on leave.

Ugah a Dayak drew his parang during a drinking bout in his house above Kanowit and, the parang flying out of his hand struck his mother-in-law on the leg severing an artery her death resulting
Ugah was fined two piculs and $60 pati nyawa.
A number of fines were imposed for various other offences but none of any importance.
Public Works. -The prison gang carried a quantity of gravel for the roads and were employed on various odd jobs about the station.
The Tamils completed the new road to the offices and another to the wireless operator's quarters and weeded the race course.
Heavy rain and high water interfered considerably with all out-door Work.
The carpenters started putting a new floor into the fort. With the exception of the roof which is new the whole of this building is rotten. All the planking and beams of the floor are completely rotten, the suits, which should have been of bilian, are only semayor and also rotten and the whole of one side of the fort floor, part of which carried one of the heavy guns, was supported only by a partition walling underneath. It is marvellous that a serious accident has not happened when the fort has been crowded.
As no other building is available for offices the fort must be temporarily repaired but it is doubtful whether the expenditure is worth while as, owing to the rapid erosion of the river bank the whole building will have to be pulled down within a very few years and new offices built farther inland.
In fact, the present swampy island is totally unsuitable for the headquarters of such a rapidly grow-
ing district as this, there being no room for anymore bunglows and the situ being incapable of expansion, besides it being so low lying and unhealthy with no water supply. A new site for the head-quarters of the Rejang on high ground with a proper
262	THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, DECEMBER 1, 1920.
water supply available will have to be decided on very shortly and there should be no great difficulty in this, excellent and suitable places being easily found. The lack of a water supply is responsible for the recent out-break of dysentery while typhoid cases have also occurred.
The wharf, on which many thousands of dollars have been waited, is rapidly disappearing owing to the erosion of the bank and I am not spending any more on its up-keep as such expenditure would be a mere waste of money.
Four Lux lamps have been erected in the bazaar but, owing to their having been incomplete when sent from Kuching, they have not yet been lighted.
One hundred kampong men cleared up the site of the old godowns on the river bank, collected all bilian timber which was lying imbedded in the ground as well as other timber, bricks, iron rails, etc , etc., and the site was prepared for a new P. W. D. godown which it is proposed to erect as soon as possible.
General.Sun Teng, a Chinese at Selalang, hanged himself after being bitten by a scorpion, he being apparently unable to bear the pain.
Mr. and Mrs. Mead and child returned to Kuching in the Alice Lorraine on the 2nd.
The s. s. Flevo sailed for Singapore on the same day with a full cargo, the s. s. Batavier following her next day after repairs had been effected to her boiler. She has been anchored in the river since early last month awaiting boiler makers from Singapore.
The Norwegian s. s. Halydan arrived from Hong
Kong on the 14th. to load timber at Rejang for Messrs. Tong Lee Wah.
Mr J. B. Archer returned from short leave by the s s. Sarawak on the 14th.
The s. s. Flevo arrived from Singapore on the 16th.
leaving again on the 20th. She was fully loaded each way.
Mr. Jacques went to Kapit on the 23rd. to audit the accounts there.
The jurugan of the s. I. Mermaid went on a short leave to Kuching and absconded to Singapore. It appeared afterwards that he had taken a quantity of jewellery belonging to his relations here and had also succeeded in obtaining heavy advances on behalf of himself and the crew of the launch at Simanggang, Sadong and Kuching which have not been repaid. The crew do not appear to have derived much advantage from his transactions on their behalf.
The total eclipse of the moon on the night of the 27th was heralded by the usual din of gongs and other noise producing instruments from the bazaar and kampongs. The sky was clear and the eclipse an unusually fine sight.
There were heavy rainstorms throughout the month
resulting in a flood when the freshet met the high tides at full moon, the island and much of the surrounding country being under water at every tide. One of the buffaloes got into difficulties in the flood and was drowned.
Ah Khui, a prisoner in irons, jumped into the river and drowned himself. His body was recovered on the 30th.
The Alice Lorraine arrived from Kuching via Kabong on the 28th. after unloading the materials for a Checking Station for the Forest Department at Rejang. She returned next day.
Since the restrictions on trading in padi and rice have been removed the price of rice has risen from between 30 and 40 cents to $1.20 to $1.40 per gantang.
The majority of the Dayaks however still sell their padi for a dollar a passu though they could obtain much higher prices did they hold out for them. Traders in rice are consequently making big profits.
Prices of everything at Sibu are very much in advance of those in Kuching despite the direct communication with Singapore.
The fall in the price of rubber is seriously affecting the Chinese planters here who, apart from their rubber and padi plantations have nothing to rely on for a living. The padi harvest will not be for some months yet and, unless rubber rises in price very soon the greater number of the Foochows hero will be in very serious difficulties and unable to purchase food supplies.

September.
Court -- No cases of importance were heard during the month.
P. W. D. -The prisoners were engaged in the usual work of this station, while the mandor with three men was at work on the bilian mast for the proposed wireless station. One mast was spliced and trimmed and is now reedy for erection. The total length is 109 feet 9 inches.
General.The 27th. His Highness the Rajahs birthday was observed as a holiday and the officers closed.
On the 9th s. l. Chamois arrived from Sibu with Messrs. D. A. Owen and J. P. Mead. During his visit Mr. Owen met most of the headmen of the district and also paid a visit to Pandan. No appeal cases were down for bearing. A local order was issued temporarily prohibiting the export of bilian, attaps to ports outside Sarawak, except in a case where a previous contract remained unfilled. A dispute about the site of a proposed bandarsah was also investigated.
The s. 1. Chamois called again on the 22nd. with a passenger, Mr St. V. B. Down, who stayed at Bintulu for several days and left later for Balingean by bandong. Mr E. S. Holl was also a visitor to the station spending his time at Kidurong where he inspected the timber with a view to a concession.

Tatau.--- I visited this station, with Native Officer Abang Naga on the 11th and returned here on the 19th. I found that it was impossible to obtain padi from the Dayaks in S. Anap, where the harvest was a failure; the total purchased in the Tatau river on Government account amounted to over 900 passus. The Dayaks on the main river had a good crop and a certain amount has been sold and imported to Bintulu. Cases heard in Court included inheritance disputes, land cases and one in which a Punan was suspected of witchcraft. I spent one night up-river at Tama Grans house and investigated two small disputes about sago-land. In one of these a Bukitan was found to have an interest in the plantation, which, however, did not amount to more than twenty palms though covering many acres of land. The Tatans, who share the Punan village, still continue their five year-old debate where to build their new house, but it seems that a decision may be arrived at shortly.
I brought back 48 bags of padi for use at this station, though its arrival was delayed by rough

weather. As the month of the river was closed I walked back here, a journey avoided whenever possible owing to a stretch of mud-flats covering nearly twelve miles between the two rivers.
Court. No cases call for mention and during the month Court work was light.
P. W. D. A second mast for the proposed wireless station was completed by the prisoners; its total length is 109 feet 4 inches. For the remainder of the month the prisoners were employed upon the roads and husking padi.
General. - At the beginning of the month several deaths were reported from the kampong.
At the request of the District Officers at Limbang, Oya and Sibu contracts were entered into for a supply of bilian attaps for these stations.
During the month Lakat (T. K. of Kadayans) asked leave to move to S. Plan where a few Kadayans have farmed for several years, he also requested that several families of relations should be allowed to join him from Brooketon.
According to Dayak information the engkabang trees are in flower, though it is too early to forecast the probability of a crop: padi is said to be doing well in all parts of the river.
P. S. Adeh called three times at Kidurong point on her way north.

October.
Court. The number of thefts reported have been above the average.
The following sentences were inflicted. Bong Lian for being in possession of stolen property three months R. I. Apong, a Mohamedan Dayak, three months for misappropriation of property. Chop Seng Bin were fined $100 for attempting to evade the customs duty on rotan exported. Sapar two years imprisonment for being in possession of a stolen buffalo, and slaughtering same. In connection with this case Orang Kaya Binjai was fined $50; he as Tuah Kampong had neglected to carry out the local regulations concerning buffaloes.
General.The Pandaruan Custom Farm has been leased to Ah Boi from the 1st. instant for a term of three years, at an increased rental of 165%.
Arrangements have now been made whereby the Limbang Customs station is open Saturday afternoons and Sundays, the same as on ordinary week days. This concession is greatly appreciated by the local inhabitants and others, who often had to tie tip, in their small open boats, at the Government wharf from 11 a. in. Saturday to 8 a. m. Monday.
Mr. MacBryan had to go over to Labuan on the 18th. for medical advice. He returned again on the 21st. Dr. Cleverton of Labuan reported he had been suffering from dysentery and malaria.
Captain E. V. Andremi arrived, by the Adeh, on the 23rd. He left again by her, the next morning, for Brooketon en route for Lawas, to which district he has been appointed vice Mr. Skrine.
I was away at Brooketon from the 13th. to the 16th. I returned by the Lucile the Damit being in dock having a new-propeller shaft fitted, and being generally overhauled.
Miss Swayne left for Miri by the Adeh on the 24th.
P. W. D.The small gang of prisoners is still
engaged on the Sungei Poyan road. The road coolies have finished cleaning out the ditches on the 5th. mile round, have cleared the road to the top of Bukit Tuna, and have felled more jungle behind the District Officer's bungalow.
Abang Tamil has re-erected the channel marks at Kuala Limbang, destroyed by the recent freshes.
Heavy rains have resulted in many landslides on the surrounding hills, both the Sungei Poyan and the Limpang roads being blocked from this cause. An entirely new ravine has been formed alongside the pipe line, which will necessitate the latter having to be moved.
The rainfall registered 24'84 inches, the highest recorded for any one day was 7'85 inches.
Shipping and Trade.The p. s. Adeh, s. I. Lucile and the m. I. Adele each called in twice during the month, and the s. I. Peter Duff once. Eighty three buffaloes were shipped to Kuching.

PROVISIONS.
WE beg to announce that we have recently been appointed Sole Agents in Sarawak. Brunei and British North Borneo for Messrs. Joseph Travers & Sons, Limited, proprietors of the well-known SHIP and SIGNAL brands of TINNED PROVISIONS and are now ready to commence business on wholesale lines.
It is still impossible to obtain adequate supplies from England and the Colonies but the situation becomes easier week by week and we hope shortly to be able to meet all demands.
We shall be pleased to send price lists on application.
