NOTES.
(May.)
OWING to the large number of forged $5 notes that are in circulation in Kuching and probably elsewhere, it may be of interest to call attention to some of the points by which these forgeries, which are excellent imitations of the good notes, can be detected.
The general appearance of the forged notes is much darker and the printing less distinct, than that of the good notes. This is particularly noticeable in the words Government of the Straits Settlements and the words on the coat of arms, the hitter perhaps caused some trouble to the forger, whose French may be a little rusty. The imitation is, however, so clever that few of the differences between on the good and bad notes can be seen without the use of a magnifying glass, but the following can be detected with the naked eye :
(1) The words Thus. De La Rue & Co., Ltd., London, on the front of the note at the bottom, are evidently cut out of a wood block, the letters being thicker than those on a good note and very uneven.
(2) The word on" in the sentence Promise to pay bearer on demand" is printed "in on the bad note, that is to say, the o is like an i" without the dot.
Forgeries have already been detected in $5 notes of series B/26, B/44 and B/50, and it is quite possible that other series have also been forged.
MESSRS. Dunn and Haldane bought a boat and entered her for the annual Sadong Regatta under the mime Sri Pussy Foot. We regret that this sporting effort was not rewarded with victory, but understand that Sri Pussy Foot headed the list of also ran.

meet her. His Excellency was appointed Governor General of the Philippine Islands in 1913 and has held that post longer than any of his predecessors.
It may be of interest to any person contemplating matrimony that only two forms of marriage ceremony are in existence in Mongolia; capturing a bride or buying her: in the first case, the bride to-be flees on horseback if she is captured, or allows herself to be captured, the marriage is celebrated without further formalities; on the other hand, if she escapes, the bridegroom goes sadly homewards.
The second methodpurchaseis less romantic. The cost varies from live camels for
a young girl to 30 camels for a widow of 40, the latter being quoted higher than all others. In some classes a wife may even be bought for a few pounds of rice.
THE Hon. J. Baring-Gould is retiring after 23 years in Sarawak. He joined the Service in March 1897 at the age of 20, and served as a Cadet at Simanggang. He went to Sibu as Resident 2nd Class ip 1902. and was appointed Resident of the 3rd Division in 1911, and a Member of the Committee of Administration in 1915. His retirement will be a great loss to the Service and to the many friends he and Mrs. Baring-Gould leave behind in Sarawak.
WE are asked to announce that a Committee has been formed consisting of Capt. S. Cunynghame, Mr. C. Fenwick and Mr. F. F. Boult toe running a Sarawak Derby Sweep. Tickets, which are $5.00 each maybe purchased from any of the above. Fuller particulars will be published later. As time is short, people in outstations, are asked to wire, where possible, the number of tickets they require.

THE Governor General of the Philippine Islands Francis Burton Harrison paid a brief informal visit to Kuching on the 1st. He arrived on the Susanna II, which anchored off Goebilt, and came up the river on the Young Harry reaching Kuching about 11.30 a. m.
Unfortunately the news of his arrival did not reach Kuching long before the Governor General, who was not expected till the afternoon, so it was impossible to give him as good a reception as was desired. His Excellency
was accompanied by his wife and daughter, his Aide-de-Camp, Brigadier General R. W. Jones and the Bishop of the Philippines. The party unfortunately had to leave by the s.s. Kuching in the afternoon, but found time, during their short stay, to visit the Museumand other places of interest. The charm and beauty of the Governors wife, won the admiration of ail. who were fortunate enough to

A number of bilitian boundary marks were worked and sent to the Land Office in Kuching.
The prisoners have been employed on the Buan Road. The Bau Lama Road is being raised from 2 to 4 feet as far as the high ground This work was still going on at the end of the month. The whole of the timber from the old Paku bungalow has been brought to Bau. There has been a good deal of other work for the gangs, such as carrying rice, and timber for the barracks, and work on roads has been, in consequence, rather slow.
Towards the end of the month the continual rainstorms have delayed the completion of the Bau Lama Road.
General. I arrived at Bau on the 17th. of the month, and took over charge of the district on the 19th. The Honble. Mr D A. Owen and family left for Kuching on the 21st.
On the 24th. of the month two Chinese prisoners escaped from the gang working on Bau Lama Road. Up to the end of the month they had not been recaptured, but it is certain that they are still in the vicinity. Both men were short sentence prisoners
A certain quantity of rice is now being brought down by Dayaks and this is being purchased by Government.
The total rainfall for the month of April was 1395 inches

SADONG.
March.
Early in the month work was begun on the new padi godown, and good progress has been made on the building.
On the 9th. a Chinese prisoner named Chin Wah escaped, and at the time of writing is still at large. He is working his way up-river, probably with the idea of escaping across the border into Dutch Borneo. He stole a boat and sonic food from a lonely house below Gedong, but has not been heard of since. All Dayaks have been warned and ordered to bring in any strange Chinese they may find roaming around.
Mr. J. P. Mead, Conservator of Forests and Mr. J. R. Barnes, Superintendent of Wireless Telegraphs arrived by s. 1. Lucile on the 11th and returned again on the 14th. While here a site was chosen for the Forest Checking Station, which is to be No. 7. Work will be started on this building as soon as the padi godown is finished. Various matters concerning Forest Rules were discussed and arrangements made for checking the timber used by the Collieries, and the collecting of royalty on same.
The jelutong inspectors are now transferred to the Forest Department in the rank of forest guards ; and another man has been sent to Kuching to be instructed in the measuring and classifying of timber.
Mr. Barnes inspected the wireless plant.
His Highness the Rajah was pleased to visit the station and accompanied by Mr. G. M. Gifford arrived in H. H. S. Y. Zahora on the 17th.
On the 18th. His Highness visited the Government Collieries, aud accompanied by me Manager Mr J. W. Evans, spent several hours visiting the mines, machine shops, saw mill, hospital, etc.
The following morning His Highness met the Native Officers, and various other persons in the Court house, where all were enabled to speak on any matters that occurred to them.
His Highness sailed for Sibu during the afternoon.
Messrs. Dun and Haldane of Messrs the Sarawak Rubber Estates, Ltd. returned from the ulu Gedong at noon on the 17th. for provisions, and left again for that place the following afternoon.
Court work has been light during the month, some cases of breach of jelutong regulations, a few
cases of theft, and a caw of profiteering on the sale of condensed milk have been dealt with. The majority of people are still busy harvesting.
The people of Jaie Laut and S'bangan are re-planting padi; their crops having been ruined by the high tides. This new padi should be harvested before the landas, but in the mean time it may be necessary to feed some of the people in these two kampongs.
The annual Sadong Regatta was held on Monday the 29th, and all say WHS a great success. There were not a great many entries for the long boat races, and the reason was"bras mahal, but the races were keenly contested.
The land sports, judging by the way they were patronized, were most popular, and a long programme was carried out.
The subscriptions amounted to over $600, which, I am told, is a record. It was all spent. The bazaar did a good business on that day.
I am greatly indebted to Mr. C. G. Dun, Mr. E. H. Haldane, Mr. J. W. Evans and Mr. D. Evans, also to Mr. Lau Loong Quee, Haji Medin, Chia Muk Kim and all others, who assisted to make the day the successor undoubtedly was.
Nine steamers and three schooners entered and cleared the port during the month.

April.
Early in the month ten Dayak prisoners arrived from Sibu to work timber in the neighbourhood of the Collieries for the Public Works Department Kuching.
On the 16th I left for Gedong, returning on the 20th. Mr. C. G. Dun accompanied me and proceeded to Sungei Krite to prospect for Lind suitable for pepper growing. He returned on the 28th. Mr. Dun has been prospecting in various places in the ulu Gedong all this month, but has, I am afraid, been badly handicapped through the difficulty in obtaining labour, and has even found it necessary to import stray Dayaks from Kuching in order to rentis, tebas and act as coolies generally.
It is impossible to procure labour here at present, every one being on a stampede for jelutong.
There has been a certain amount of unrest lately amongst the mine coolies, on account of the excessive charges made by the Hylam shop-keeper Wee Kok Khian. This man has kept a shop at the Colliery, and also in the Simunjan bazaar for some years now, and, from what I gather, undertook to keep a decent shop at the mine and supply the coolies with their necessities at a fair price.
I find however that his prices are exhorbitant in his bazaar shop, and according to a list of purchases made by coolies at the mine and sent me by Mr. Evans, that he is charging them even more, and only keeps a very poor stock at the Colliery, for fear of being raided. This is unfair, as there is no freight charged on his goods from wharf to Colliery, aud all debts are settled each pay day.
This man deals principally with Ban Jui Long in Kuching, and I should imagine they do pretty well between them. I have sent a list of some of his prices to the Food Control Officer Kuching.
He seems to be profiteering on the mine coolies and also on the Europeans, as a 1 lb. tin of Assam tea was bought for $1.70 and a 2ozs. bottle of Bovril for 90 cents, and it is the same with everything. These Hylams seem to reckon that anything below a 50% profit is a loss.
On the 23rd a Chinese prisoner Bong Fa, while working in the gang, made a bolt for liberty. After an exciting chase and a fight, he was recaptured by the mandor, the other prisoners assisting. After this he flatly refused to work, and so has been sent to complete his sentence at Kuching, where, I have no doubt, means will be found to make him work.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, MAY 17, 1920.
The Dalat road, which appears not to have been repaired for some years, was raised and every bridge rebuilt. The long Hud bridge was also repaired. The police barracks at Dalat is a most disreputable building and will have to be completely rebuilt shortly. The BakongTrus road, which has been neglected for some years, will be put in good condition and bridges rebuilt as soon as there is sufficient labour. All the other Oya roads are now in good condition and fit for ponies.
Food Control The Oya people bave finished harvesting and the crops are good. It is a pity the farms were not more numerous and bigger. The exception is Kampong Trus, where the crops were destroyed by mice.
The Dayaks seem to have had good crops, but they refuse to sell any parli at all for which they are not to be blamed. It is to be hoped that later on a local supply of rice will be forthcoming. The sales of imported rice at the Government depot in Oya continue and the system appears to be working fairly well.
Trade.It appears that the DalatSibu trade returns have not been included in the Oya district returns. In future they will be included. Most of the rubber is taken direct to Sibu and in the landas a lot of jelutong is shipped there.

Resident 2nd Class.
MUKAH.
April.
I arrived here rm the 9th. and took over from Mr. H. L. Owen who left for Kuching by the s.l. Chamois on the 15th.
Work in the Courts has been slight, and those cases which were brought up were chiefly disputes as to ownership of sago lands.
I was away visiting Balingian from 25th. to 29th. Several cases were brought up for settlement. Reports as to the padi harvest varied, but on the whole it is hoped that the Dayaks gathered in sufficient for their own need $9.000 was remitted to the Mukah Treasury.
The Government barong is in a very leaky condition and is considered unsafe to use in a rough sea.
On the 22nd. the junk Sin Kiat Siang, manned by a Chinese crew, with a cargo 30 koyans of raw sago bound for Kuching, got stranded on the bar. The crew were wholly to blame as they refused to follow the pilot's orders. Part of the cargo has been salved. As she is obstructing the chauuel the owner has been ordered to break her up.
The Petanak people were called out to clear the low jungle lying between the fort and the beach.
The price of raw sago has fallen considerably fetching only $1.60 a pasu.
A portion of the flooring of the sitting room of the bungalow was opened up and renewed with bilian timber.
Twenty-eight sailing vessels entered and twenty- six cleared.
The principal trade returns are as follows : 1919. 1920.
Raw sago	... 490 koyans. 519 koyans.
Jelutong	... 388 piculs. 810 piculs.
W. R. TUDOR CLEMENT,
Resident 2nd Class.
A good deal of tax has been collected and of this padi to the amount of eight koyans has been paid.
Penghulu Wins house of twenty-one doors in Sungei Bulu was burnt down. Eleven doors had brought their padi in from the farms, and over ten koyans was destroyed.
Ten steamers and five schooners entered and cleared the port during the month.
There was 1,544 tons 4 cwts. of coal exported

Resident 2nd Class.
OYA.
March.
General.On the 1st. the Honble. the Resident 3rd Division sat in Appeal Court at Oya. On the 2nd. the Honble. the Resident accompanied by Mr. H. L. Owen and myself, visited Medong in the launch. The celebrated high houses there are now almost deserted, the modern Melanau preferring to live nearer the ground.
Mr. H. L. Owen left for Mukah on the 3rd. and on the same day the Honble. the Resident sat in Appeal Court again. He left on the next day for Matu.
Chan Hock Soon, the Oya Court Writer, left the sei vice on the 4th. and was replaced by Ansin. late of the Museum staff, on the 6th.
A small bandong from Balingian and bound for Sibu was wrecked near the light-house on the 6th. About two-thirds of the cargo was salved, but the vessel went to pieces in about two hours. No lives were lost.
On the 27th. at 8 a.m. the schooner Kim Hak Seng 42 tons, Juragan Bujang went ashore in almost the same place. It appears that she was leaving the river with a land breeze, when just opposite the lighthouse the wind veered round to N. E. and the schooner was driven ashore. A fairly heavy sea was running and in spite of assistance and the removal of the deck cargo she could not be moved. She began to break up the same night and on the next day about four koyans of sago flour were salved. The masts were cut away and all her standing and running rigging, sails, anchors, deck gear, etc., were removed. At time of writing little of the wreck remains.
I left for Dalat on the 14th. returning on the 20th. I regret to report that the notorious Tuanku Brahim escaped from the gang during my absence and has not yet been recaptured. The mandor was punished. I fear that the man will get clean away, as he seems to have had a marvellous influence over the natives, and would probably be able to frighten them into giving him assistance.
I left for Mukah on the 23rd. to see the Resident there about some new proposals with regard to sago lands. I returned on the 27th.
Courts.Appeal Court. In two cases the appeals were up-held and in the remaining case the appeal was dismissed. Tambi Hussin and others versus Ah Hong, claims for salvage fees. Judgment was given against defendant for $300 and costs.
With regard to the Kim Hak Seng salvage claims, the owners of the salved cargo behaved very badly and the local fisherman were awarded about $700. This includes the ship's gear saved. There were a great number of cases before the Courts during the month, mostly concerning sago lands. There were also more than the usual number of assault cases.
I regret to say that the thieving at Dalat appears to be on the increase.
P. W. D., etc.The new lamps at the quala were lit for the first time on the 24th.
BINTULU
March.
CourtCases before the Court related for the most part to disputes about jelutong roads and fruit groves and were not of great importance. A number of Dayaks working enkabang in S. Semalijau where their presence has been forbidden, were recalled and find.
P. W. D The prisoners have been engaged at Kidurong repainting the lighthouse. A new floor was put in the fortmen's dapor and the Government barong was refitted.
Tubau I was away up-river from the 4th.9th. with the Native Officer. Datu Haji Abdullah. Very few eases came up for settlement as most of the inhabitants were still harvesting or collecting engkabang. I understand the Dayak padi this year, has only been partially successful, and though they should have a sufficiency for themselves, there will not be a large surplus for sale. Engkabang has been plentiful in certain small streams, but by no means in all. The price in the up-river bazaar was $9.50 per pikul, and I imagine a good deal was being kept back for a rise in price.
General.In accordance with instructions from Kuching stocks of opium, bold in the local bazaar and in that at Tatau were checked at the beginning of the month.
I regret to report that Sedai, wife of Haji Drahman. Tua Kampong. was taken by a crocodile ; the reptile was hunted and destroyed and the remains recovered and buried.
The s s. Sarawak cleared once from here and also called off Kidurong Point, on her return trip she entered the Tatan for cargo. The p. s. Adeh called off Kidurong on the 23rd. Three mails were brought by schooner.
The Order forbidding the hoarding of copper currency was made public on its receipt here, but so far has led to no result. The shortage of small change is being felt in the bazaar.
The rainfall for the month amounted to 3'49 inches.
April.
Court. Owing to the presence in the bazaar of a number of Dayaks, engaged on clearing the telephone line, a number of their cases came up for hearing. A serious assault case in one of the kampong was adjourned, as one of the parties had not recovered from the injuries he had received.
P.W. D.Dayaks cleared the telephone line from here to S. Stiam and arrangements have been made with the Tatau Dayaks to do their share next month. The prisoners were engaged on the roads and ornamental grounds.	.
Tatau. I was away at Tatau from the 12th 22nd. accompanied by the Native Officer, Abang Naga. Dayak cases were plentiful, but of no serious importance.
Padi harvesting was still going on and the harvest for the most part is a good one. I visited the Punans in the Kakus and spent a night at Tama Grans house, a very substantial building. Belian is being worked in large quantities in this branch of the river where there is a permanent encampment of Chinese sawyers. The limber is exported direct to China by junk.
General. Good Friday and Easter Monday were observed as public holidays and the offices closed.
A contract of 100,000 belian ataps was made with a local timber merchant at the request of the Honble. the Acting Resident of the First Division and half that number were sent direct to Miri on Government account by the s. 1. La Follette, who called in to pick up the Anglo-Saxon Company's timber-lighter.
The p. s. Adeh called off Kidurong on the 1st. and 23rd. and entered the river on the 9th. On the last occasion the Right Rev, the Bishop of the Diocese and Mrs. Danson with Major Benjamin, Manager of the Anglo-Saxon Oil Co.; came ashore. The m. t. Miri and s. s. Gladys both entered on the 13th. the first clearing for Kuching the same day and the latter on the 15th.
Haji Drahman. the loss of whose wife I reported last month, has made a most energetic and successful attack on the local crocodiles, four of which (averaging just under 12 feet each) he has brought in during the month.
The rainfall for the month amounted to 1204 inches.
J. C. SWAYNE.

LAWAS.
?
February.
Having received instructions to take charge of the Lawns and Trusan districts. I accompanied the Honble. the Divisional Resident here in the s. s. LAubaine on the 5th. atid took over from Datu Haji Halil the following day.
After the Honble. the Resident's departure, I proceeded to Trusan via the overland route accompanied by Datu Haji Halil: we returned here via Sundar and Punang on the 21st.
Mr. J P. Baird, of the Lawas Planting Company Limited, also accompanied me to Trusan to arrange about obtaining supplies of native rice and padi for the Company's employees.
During the month I checked the chief clerk's accounts both here and at Trusan and found all correct ; the Customs accounts at Sundar were however not so well kept.
In the Courts: Moktar bin Ali Hassan was sentenced to six months H. L. for intimidation and assault. Minah binti Haji was imprisoned for theft and sent to Limbang to serve her sentence, and Yong Ah Lak, of the gambling farm, was fined for assaulting and injuring Prison Mander Mohamet Nur.
Chinese New Years day on the 20th. was observed as a public holiday.
On the 28th. I received instructions from the Honble. the Divisional Resident to check all existing stocks of opium, and notify the Chinese of the increase in price; and on the 30th. I received orders to double all export duties at once.
Early in the mouth all the Government employees both here and at Trusan were informed that, now the local padi is being harvested, rice rationing will cease from the 1st. March.
Native rice is obtainable here at 80 cents per gantang and padi 4 gantangs per dollar.
Rewards have been offered to anyone reporting the smuggling of rice or padi to foreign countries.
The m. t. Miri cleared for Miri on the 5th. with a cargo of sweet potatoes.
The telephone line to the Lawas Planting Company's Estate, which had been out of order for some time was cleared and generally overhauled ; and the line to Trusan, which had become very overgrown, was also recleared.
The prison gang of fourteen iiersons was chiefly employed clearing around the station.
The rainfall amounted to 7'16 inches.

OLD CYCLES BEING OVERHAULED.
The scarcity of bicycles has resulted in a very large number of cyclists deciding to make the old machine do," and where a rider owns a first-class make this is very often a wise process. For there's many a good tune played on an old fiddle, and a good old bicycle is always better than a trashy new one. The Raleigh Cycle Co. tell us that there has never been such a rush of bicycles in for overhaul as there is to-day, most of these being Raleighs of ten, fifteen, and twenty years ago, which their owners are having done up" for the summer. Sometimes as many as Hurry of these machines are received at Nottingham in a day. The lasting qualities ol such a bicycle as the Raleigh are, of course, one of its recommendations. For a Raleigh does, indeed, with very little attention, last a life-time.
