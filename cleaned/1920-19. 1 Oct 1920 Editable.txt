His Highness the Rajahs birthday on the 26th. September, falling this year on a Sunday, was commemorated on the 27th. which was observed as a public holiday. The usual salute was fired and the Resident entertained the European Community and the leading Chinese, including the Chinese Consuls from British North Borneo, who is on a visit to Kuching, at the Residency, when His Highness health was drunk.
MR. Yeufan Yu the Chinese Consul-General from British North Borneo paid a short informal visit to Kuching arriving by the Adeh, on 23rd. and leaving by the s. s. Kuching on 29th.

CEYLONS RICE SUPPLIES.
?
Colombo Overstocked.
The rice congestion at the Chalmers Granaries, Colombo, is causing some anxiety particularly in view of the ravages of the weevils and the inevitable loss of weight and deterioration consequent upon the length of time rice has to be stored before it can be issued for consumption.
On inquiry at the office of the Food Controller on September 1 a Times of Ceylon representative was informed that an appeal has been made to the Indian Government to allow Ceylon to renounce a portion of the allotment allocated to the Colony some months ago and accepted by the Ceylon Government at a price of Rs. 1,000 per hundred baskets. The Indian Government has declined to allow Ceylon to renounce any portion of the allotment.
In reply to a further inquiry as to the possibility of re-exporting some of the huge stocks of rice at present on hand in Colombo the Food Controller said he was not in a position at the moment to make any statement. (S. F. P.)
A number of the many topics dealt with by the President of the Court of the British North Borneo Company at the annual meeting, held recently, were commented on in our last issue. But there is one other matter we may refer to which concerns the external shipping facilities of the territory. Down to the outbreak of the war the shipping to and from North Borneo, like that between Singapore and Siam, had fallen almost entirely into German hands. When hostilities began the country found itself almost cut off until the Straits Steamship Co. came to its assistance, and carried on during the war. The anticipation of further facilities on the armistice has not, however, materialised. Additional local facilities would be very welcome, but, in addition, mainline communications are also sought, and strong representations have been addressed to the P. & O. Company, requesting it to make Jesselton a port of call for some of its cargo steamers on the voyages to and from the Far East. The want of communication with overseas markets must undoubtedly hamper the expansion of trade of the territory, and it probably remains a question of what there is offering for the P. & O. or any other lines to make North Borneo a port of call, whether they will send their steamers to one or more of its ports,( L. & C. Express.)
THE s. S. Kuching sailed for Singapore on the 17th. Passengers by her were Masters Hock Seng, C. Zehnder, D. Howell, A. Zehnder, Clark and G. Bateman, Misses A. Howell, Alice Howell, E. Shew, M.

Diocese of Labuan and Sarawak.
The Bishop has been on his annual tour round the Diocese, and returned to his headquarters in Kuching, on September 13th.
The chief places visited were Miri, Labuan, Brunei, Limbang, Jesselton, Kudat, Sandakan, Tawau and Silim Popon.
He also made a special visit to Zamboanga, in the Southern Philippines, to confer with Dr. Mosher, the newly appointed Bishop of the Philippine Islands.
From the Bishops report, it seems that North Borneo shews considerable signs of development. The President of the Court of Directors, Sir West Ridgeway has recently paid a visit to the State, and appears to have come to the conclusion that Jesselton from its natural situation, is unsuitable for the capital, and the tendency is to revert to the old arrangement, and to make Sandakan the headquarters of the State.
Jesselton. apart from the rubber estates along the railway line, can never compete commercially with Sandakan as a port, for the latter place is on the route from Hongkong to Sydney, and forms a suitable coaling station for the ships on this run.
The coal is mined at Silim Popon on the Dutch border, and is conveyed by lighters to Sandakan. Quite a number of fair sized ships call in at Sandakan, during the month, and it has an excellent harbour. Further signs of development on the Sandakan side are in prospect, as that most up to date firm Messrs. Harrison and Crosfield have decided to open up a large tract of country in rubber, and a manager of great experience from Ceylon is in charge of this development. The timber business is also booming, and Sandakan bids fair to become a timber port of some consequence. The chief difficulty at the moment is the procuring of sites for bungalows, as all the land in the neighbourhood of the town is in the hands of Asiatic owners, who refuse to part under a high figure. Further, the hilly nature of the site of the town makes it very difficult to find possible sites for houses, save on the most precipitous crags. The view is magnificent, but the ascent is sometimes calculated to dump one's ardour.
The Church has a very fine site in the centre of Sandakan, thanks to the foresight of that veteran pioneer, Revd. W. H. Elton who for many years carried on the work in that part of the country singlehanded. His monument is evident to alla magnificent stone church, built entirely under his personal supervision, and largely with his own hands.
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, OCTOBER 1, 1920.

There are also two hoarding schoolsone for boys and one for girls,on the church hill at Sandakan.
The former is at present in the charge of Mr. Currey and is doing good work. The mission has been very unfortunate lately in the teaching staff of the girls school, as both the European teachers have had to go home, and one, Miss Kendrick cannot return.
But Mrs Mercer and Miss Shoebridge, have stepped into the breach, and are carrying on.
There is a nourishing Chinese mission station at Kudat under Rev. B. Mercer, a fluent Hakha Chinese speaker, and the Archdeacon is going North to take charge of the work at Jesselton and Labuan for a time.
During his tour, the Bishop confirmed 40 candidates in North Borneo; he further took charge of Sandakan for a month in the absence of the local priest, but arrangements have now been made to supply that post.
So far, the Church has no stations in the interior of North Borneo, among the real natives of the State, but there are plenty of opportunities, when the staff and the means are forthcoming.
The Bishop was much struck with the standard of the American colony in the Southern Philippines, its schools, its hospitals, its streets and stores: and also with the cordial welcome that Mrs. Danson and he received by the people of Zamboanga.
The Bishop hopes to be in residence in Kuching from now till Easter, 1921.
Rubber in Sarawak.
The following is an extract from the Agricultural Bulletin of the Straits Settlements, of September 1905.
It would now be interesting to hear from the present Custodians of the gardens mentioned if the trees are still in existence, mid to what girth they have attained at the sere and yellow age of 39 years.
The first rubber tires planted in Sarawak were from seed imported from the Botanic Gardens, Singapore, in 1881, by the Right Revd. Bishop Hose, and were almost, if not quite, the first seed produced by the old trees, which us seedlings were obtained from Kew in 1875. One of these trees is still standing in the Bishops garden at Kuching and two more in the garden of the Resident. The former measures 6 feet 4 inches in girth at three feet from the ground and the others are nearly as large. The remainder of the trees have disappeared.
I could not find that any more were planted in this district till about five years ago, when a small number were planted in the Coffee Estate on the slopes of Mount Matang. This hill consists exclusively of sandstone, and the soil on the slopes is very sandy with masses of rock and boulders scattered over it. It has for some time been planted with coffee, tea, rubbers and Mauritius hemp (Fourcroya). The soil is hardly suitable for cultivation, but the tea and coffee are still kept up and worked. The Mauritius hemp seems the only plant in cultivation which thrives. The para rubber trees, now five years old, are about the size of what one expects of two year old plants or less, though perhaps a little thicker at the base. Ficus elastica does a little better at the base of the hill, but many of the plants looked burnt and sickly higher up. Ceara rubber seemed worst of all, one would have thought that this plant if any rubber plant would have thriven in the sterile sandy soil of this hill slope, but it was wretched. Many of the trees had
fallen, others remained as dead stumps, or if alive bore only a few struggling leafy branches. One may conclude perhaps, safely, that if this sandy desert plant will not grow on those sandy sterile slopes here, it cannot be expected tv succeed in other parts of the Malay region. Round Kuching, in the cemetery and along the roads, a good many para rubber trees have been planted lately, and seem to be doing fairly well, though it is too soon yet to form an opinion of them.
I visited the plantations at Poak where Mr. Balingall kindly showed me what had been done. The rubber plantation, an extensive area, was on sandy hills with steep slopes, and was planted up with a large number of young plants. These in the lower damper spots were making very fair growth. But in some spots by the streams which looked at first sight favourable, the plants had utterly failed. Examination of the soil showed these spots were remarkably sandy, confirming the opinion that para rubber dislikes sandy soil more than any other. On the tops of the hill ridges again the young plants were obviously suffering from the wind to which they; were exposed. On a few slopes the plants though protected from wind, and in fairly good soil, appeared also not to thrive. This I believe was due to underground water currents, especially as in one or two of these slopes springs ran out at the base.
Many people probably know that isolated trees on hill slopes usually do not thrive as well if they grow at all, as those at the top and bottom of the slopes. This appears to be due to the action of underground water currents which interfere with the growth or action of roots.
The greater part of the hills of Sarawak, at least that portion which I have seen, are sandstone or limestone, and a great area of the diluvium of the lower country is therefore very sandy. But the Lundu Hills which I visited are granitic, composed of a fine-grained granite. Below the base of the hills is a flat open plain of considerable size, formerly-cultivated with tobacco. The soil here is less sandy and more argillaceous, with sandy mounds or small
hills scattered about it. This seemed to be the most suitable ground for para rubber I saw in Sarawak, and it is here that Mr. Moir has secured a concession for rubber planting. The soil is fairly dry, and full of humus for a considerable depth. A good deal of pepper has been planted here on the sandier spots. Another likely spot is along the Kuching River near Santubong, I had not time to visit this, but heard that somewhere here Chinese were planting para rubber.
H. N. RIDLEY. Fifty Years Ago.
The first number of the Sarawak Gazette appeared on August, 26th. 1870 and at once states the reasons for its existence. These were firstly to keep the Outstations supplied with news of official business, together with the latest intelligence from European telegrams and papers, and secondly to serve as a recognised report of Sarawak events in other countries. With the first object in view Reuters telegrams were published in full, so that, in the first volume of this paper, may be read the history, as it came to the East, of the Franco-Prussian war.
Almost at once the first Editor, guardedly, but definitely, laid claim to the freedom of the press. A critisism of the Rajah (arguing it was inexpedient for him to sit in person in what was then the Superior Court) led to a letter from His Highness stating that critisism of his policy in a Government
218
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, OCTOBER 1, 1920
paper was a little out of place. The Editor replied, sensibly enough, that it was no business of the Gazette to make attacks on measures adopted by authority, but he reserved to himself a broad treatment of a theory. In other day other editors made a stand for the rights of the press sometimes less diplomatically.
The most striking feature in the six months recorded in 1870 is naval development. The first number reports the launch of the Bertha, the first steamer built in Sarawak, the property of Messrs. Walters. Crocker and Company The hospitality of the owners, we are told, had prepared a plentiful supply of champagne, which may have appeased the spectators when the ship refused to be launched. The ceremony was completed the next day with the assistance of the Far East, a steamer belonging to the same owners. In the next number we hear of the arrival of the steam-yacht Fire-fly, purchased by Mr A. C. Crookshank. In September the British gunboat Algerine called from Labuan and waited in Kuching for orders. In the same month the barque Ellen Lamb, 449 tons, left direct for London with a cargo valued at $77,000 of which the following particulars are given.
Sago flour	...	3,642 piculs
Gutta percha,	etc.	...	1,229	.,
Rotans	...	41	Antimony ore,	etc.	...	471	tons
Canes	...	11,850	in no.
The Sri Sarawak, a steamer built for the Borneo Company, arrived in October and immediately started on the coastal trade, with an occasional trip to Singapore. This, the Gazette states, made the fifth steamer with head-quaters in Kuching.
By a self-denying ordinance the Government proposed to sell their trading steamer, the Royalist so that no subsidised line should interfere with the carrying service.
Correspondence, the editorial stand-by, opens in the second number with a letter from One who suffers heavily on the ever popular subject of the high cost of living. Vox populi, A long Resident and others leaped merrily into the breach and bewailed the good old days when rice was five cents the gantang and a coolies wage was twenty-three cents a day. Now, they lamented, rice is seventeen cents and a coolie can command twenty-eight cents. The remedies suggested were co-operation and the compulsory planting of padi, while the Editor, who devoted a leader to the subject, found a solution in the importation of labour.
From hints in the editorial column it is probable that correspondents were inclined to be personal and some at least of their letters remained unpublished. At the same time, in spite of continual appeals, only one writer could be found to supply a special article which deals with a trip to Pontianak.
Another feature of the time was the attention paid to agriculture. Mr. Marten (vice-consul and agent for the then Miss Coutts) presented prizes for the best crop of padi; the first prize ($50) was won by the Simpoke Dayaks with an increase of eighty-fold. The seed was imported from Java and was perhaps not so good as the finer sorts grown by the Dayaks, but the yield was considerably more abundant Coffee at Matang is reported to be doing well, and indigo, grown by Chinese, is equal to any grown in the East. Mr. Marten was also responsible for the introduction of a padi-husking machine at Lundu.
During the year a distribution of sixty head of cattle was made to natives on the sea coast in the hope that the former would increase and in time form a valuable export. However a paragraph in a later number calls attention to the spread of a cattle
disease which had proved fatal to all buffaloes and pigs (jungle and domestic) and which had also attacked cattle, though with less disastrous results.
Only one advertisement appeals in the first years issue ; this is from an anonymous gentleman who wished to raffle a first-rate bagatelle tabia and a handsome plated luncheon frame, tickets were to be $3 each and the subscribers were to number twenty-eight. In the same period only one death and one birth are recorded. The first is the death of Captain Harris of the s. s. Royalist, who was found drowned while the vessel was in port. The second is the birth of a daughter to Their Highnesses the Rajah and Ranee, at Government House, on September the 21st. This was Ghita, the Rajahs only daughter, whose sad death occurred later in the Red Sea.
The announcement is made in September of the arrival of a memorial to the late Sir James Brooke. The subscription list had been opened to the Europeans and natives in the country and provided sufficient to purchase a handsome bronze bust by Woolmer which was to be placed in the new Court House then under consideration.
A full account is given of the third meeting of the Council Negri, which took place at Kuching and was attended by the Residents of Sarawak, Simanggang, Kalaka, Sibu, Mukah and Bintulu, with Dr. Houghton and twenty native chiefs, Malay and Dayak. A form of oath was promulgated and all members were sworn in, while the Rajah himself took the oath by which he was to govern the country in the years to come. Four Courts were recognised as the basis of the legal system the Superior, the Police, the Magistrates and the Datus or Native Court. After the formal proceedings a dispatch to the Sultan of Brunei was read complaining of unjust treatment which subjects of Sarawak hail met with at the hands of Brunean natives. The members for Bintulu stated that four men from that district had been sold into shivery, and that if no redress was obtainable, it was likely that the inhabitants would take the law into their own hands.
Lack of space prevents more than the statement that it was in this year that the kampong roads, which are now a feature of Kuching, were put in hand, that a secular school for Chinese children was started by Government and that the first serious attempt was made to explore the coal-fields of Sadong: but perhaps the foregoing has been sufficient for the reader to realise that the Gazette of fifty years ago was not very different from that of today, and even to make him wonder why it was that the Editor of the old Sporting Times. as he blue-pencilled an anecdote, should suggest to his correspondent that he should try the Sarawak Gazette.

DEAR SIR,
Apropos of this Poker argument which appeared in the last Gazette may I enquire, with all due respect to Mr. Carl Lawson, why a man who has the colossal courage to open a Jack Pot without having any openers, but takes a very long and sporting chance of tilling his hand, with the almost ab-

solute certainty of being discovered should he fail and so made to double the money on the table ; why I ask should that man be hounded out of the best society in Johannesburg or anywhere else for that matter? There being no definitely fixed rules of Poker, who can say that the game as played in Johannesburg is correct. Further your original correspondent F. G. D. admits that a man is entitled to open a Jack Pot with one Jack only provided he draws another and has the effrontery to tell a deliberate lie by saying he had them both when he opened, presumably because he cannot be found out. This individual in my opinion is the person that should suffer at the hands of any society Johannesburg included. I fail to see anything shady in A's play, rather I consider him to be both a sports-man and a philanthropist".

DEAR SIR,
Will you kindly give me information on the
following subject.
In a billiard handicap a prize is given for the
highest break.
A. makes a break of 47 during the game.
B. has 45 to make to win the game, and makes a break of 57. Who wins the break prize?
CURIOUS.
KUCHING, SARAWAK.

The Editor,

DEAR SIR,
As an interested party for it prize given by a
worthy member of our club for the highest break in
a billiards tournament, I have to appeal to you or
one of your leaders who knows the game for a
correct decision.
1. The prize was offered for the highest break in a billiards tournament of 250 up.
2. A break considered the highest was made by A" during the middle of the tournament and well within the game at play.
3. B" wins the tournament in the final with an unfinished break lower than the last highest and continues his break till he is well passed As break.
4. Who should get the prize for the highest
break of the tournament?
My argument is that all games ceased at the score
of 250, and the tournament ceased on the completion of 250 by the winner in the final, hence A wins the prize for the highest break of the tournament.
If however this view is not accepted, and B" gets a decision in his favour for the highest break, partly made during the tournament and partly out of it, then I think the intention of the donor must be ascertained, as he alone may give such a decision.
What do you think Editor?
Yours faithfully,
BILLIARDS.

Court.Metop, a bad character, was sentenced to three years R. I. for returning a second time to the district after having been banished therefrom.
Bujang, a prisoner, received the usual punishment for escaping while in custody, and an extra six months R. I. for stealing Government rice, while Bangkum, ex-cowman, received one dozen with the rotan and another three months R. I. for being implicated in the theft, and attempting to dispose of the stolen rice.
Tutil, of Kampong Tanam, was ordered to compensate the owners $25 each, for killing then hunting dogs, which he alleged were worrying his pig trap.
He appealed against this decision, arguing that he had forbidden" anyone to hunt in the jungle near his trap.
Appeal was dismissed by the Resident 3rd. Division.
Ula and Libaai were each imprisoned for three months for theft of mulong trees. The latter a further three months for gross contempt of Court, and an attempt to evade arrest.
Tuanku Brahim, a notorious imposter, who escaped from Oya gaol some nine months ago, was captured near Matu by police from Sibu.
Hamdan, juragan of schooner Kim Ho Ann was ordered by Resident 3rd. Division to refund $105, being value of salved fish net, and fined for not depositing it in the Court after entering port.
P. W. D.-Tenders submitted, regarding erection of new police barracks, have been altogether too exhorbitant.
Arrangements, therefore, have been made with local kampongs for supplies of softwood, and prison labour will probably be used when the up-river Dayaks have worked the biliau timber, etc., and all the materials have been delivered.
Telephonic communication with Sibu was cut for several days. An inspecting party from Sibu eventually located a break and repaired it.
There has been incessant trouble with this line, owing to the fact that men sent to inspect it, unless personally supervised, never follow the wire completely, preferring to do two-thirds of the journey in their boat. On this occasion the constable in charge of coolies was fined for an offence of this nature.
Kampong Penat are working planks for the bridge over that river, which is in need of repair.
Prisoners have been engaged in rebuilding the Government landing stage near the kuala, demolishing the old mosque, clearing ditches and attending to general work in the ornamental grounds.
Food Control ---693 gantangs were sold ex-Govern-

Natives appear to be planting in earnest this year, realizing at the eleventh hour that there was some truth in the repeated warnings given to them long ago.
