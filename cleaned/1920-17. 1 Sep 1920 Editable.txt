August.
We learn from the B. N. B. Herald, chat the Bishop and Mrs. Danson left Sandakan the 15th. July for the Philippine Islands. We understand that they have recently paid a visit to Limbang and may be expected in Kuching shortly. THE attention of our readers is called to A Notification in this issue of the Government Gazette, from which it will be seen that a Wireless Station is now is operation at Goebilt and is in daily communication with Kuching. The telephone communication between Kuching and Goebilt is discontinued for the present.
WE hear from an authentic source that one of the buffaloes recently brought to Kuching has succeeded in evading slaughter, fora time at any rate by giving birth to a calf. According to the latest reports both are doing well.
SOME further light is now vouchsafed respecting the attack by the German raider Emden on the cable station at Cocos-Keeling in the early days of the war. It is reported a Chinese was directly instrumental in summoning the Sydney. He was a servant of the Cable Company, and the landing party, meeting him, ordered him to lead them to the station. He did so, by a circuitous route, after quickly telling a countryman to hurry there and give the alarm. As a consequence, before the station wus dismantled the fateful message, had already gone. The story goes that tin Chinese responsible now lives in honourable retirement in his native town in China, justly recompensed for the part he

played in the war. Another fact is also now made known. During the fight some of the land- ing party, who had not been able to re-embark, made their escape in Mr ROSSS schooner Ayesha. Last year the German Government punctiliously presented Mr. Koss with a very neat craft in place of the one which was taken.L & C. Express.
THE mosquito plague was so serious in Paris last year that the Pasteur Institute has been devoting special attention to the destruction of the larvae. An old plan was to pour oil on the waters where mosquitoes breed, but this also killed any fish there might be in the water, besides making it unlit for drinking. M. Ronbaud, of the Pasteur Institute, has now discovered a method of destroying the larvae by sprinkling powdered formaline on the surface of the water. This does not injured fish or make water impossible to drink, and it is also said to be much more rapid and effective than oil.(S. T.)
THE following story appeared in the Straits Times one of the new rich, who had made his fortune out of the war by supplying bootlaces to the Army or something of that sort, bought an ancestral mansion in the country- in England and on entering into possession gave a large house-warming party. The pleased owner, besides providing the entertainments customary on such occasions, showed his guests over the house. Arrived in the picture gallery, the proud host stopped in front of two portraits, hanging on either side of a crucifix. Raising his hand, he pointed to the two portraits and said, in a blatant tone: These are the portraits of my ancestors. Thereupon one of the amiable guests was heard to mutter in an audible undertone: How interesting. I never knew before who the two malefactors were!

Simanggang Regatta and Sports.
These took place on the 5th and 6th. August. Crowds of natives from all over the 2nd Division had been coming in many days before that date, and the kampongs and bazaar had no further accomodation to offer.
On the 3rd., Mis Highness the Rajah. accompanied by Captain W. R. B. Gifford, Mr. E Parnell and Mr. P. H. Hayward, arrived in s. I. Mermaid from Lingga.
Lee's Cinema from Kuching had been engaged, and gave free performances throughout the week in the evenings on the plain, which were apparently vastly enjoyed by the audiences, judging from the practically continuous manjong issuing from that quarter.
The up-river tribes, collected for the Peacemaking held on the 4th. added a further touch of picturesqueness to the scene, and these people undoubtly combined business with pleasure, carrying off $l80 of the total $500 prize money of the lotteries on the boat races.
There were fewer new long boats than usual, some Balaus having apparently given up all hope of ever heating the Sri Kendawang or Sri Belalang. But this should be different next year, the so-far unbeaten Sri Kendawangs coming in third in the Champion Cup, and only securing a dead-beat in the 40 men race after a very exciting finish with the Sri Belalang. Sri Kendawangs reputation was however redeemed by an easy win from Sri Belalang in H. H. the Rajah's Cup but the latter threw away their chances by had steering after getting a good lead right up the first reach. The winner of the Champion Cup is the old Sri Matilda under new ownership This boat came in third to Sri Kendawang and Sri Belalang in the 1919 Kuching Regatta.
Other races provided some close finishes, especially the 30 men beda and long bong races.
A disappointment to sonic of the visitors was the failure of the ladies to put in an appearance for their race. Only one boat put out, and, the standard of beauty being adjudged below par, no prize was awarded. It is perhaps fortunate as a number of the ancient dames most certainly could not have stood the course.
His Highness the Rajah having presented a handsome prize, and none of the expected challengers of the Simanggang boat-building and paddling reputation putting in an appearance, this race was altered to II. H. the Rajahs Cup and won outright by the Sri Kendawang as mentioned.
The Football matches provided some capital games, and the final was very evenly contested. Lagans Sari bus tram, though obviously tiring and very luckily avoiding an equalising goal two minutes from time, winning by I 0. The following was the draw:

The Malay tiffin. Chinese luncheon, and Dayak feast would have turned a Food Controllers head grey; few could have seen so much to eat collected together in one spot in their lives, but all left their mark,

and any stray sparrows or dogs banging round looking for the remains were undoubtedly disappointed.
Amongst the features of the meeting were the processions of Balan women in the finest costumes of long ago, laden with brass trays piled up with cakes and Dayak dainties, in honour of the first visit of the Ulu Ai chieftains after the peace-making, and in return lor the splendid reception the Ulu Ai gave the down-river chiefs on their visit there in June.
The final fixture was the tuba-fishing from the month of the Skrang mi the 7th. His Highness the Rajah and party intended in s. l. Mermaid; but, though the tuba was plentiful the fish were few ; though a great number of smaller fish were caught, the larger varieties were scarce. From experience of such affairs in large rivers, it is undoubtedly the
optimist who sallies forth armed with spear and net; it has in fact been called a vice.

3. J. A. H. Hardie's Gayau Beradai.
A good try for this race was made by the Sri Belalang and Sri Kendawang crews exchanging boats, coming in first and second, but being later disqualified for this fruitless effervescence of spirit.
Two races for the Ulu Ai were arranged and both ended with the crews paddling standing up in their boats, us is their custom up the gravel beds and swift flowing reaches up river.
The Peace-making at Simanggang.
The Pence-making between the Ulu Ai Dayaks and the Skrang, Layer and Lemanak Dayaks, which had been agreed upon by their meeting at Krangan Telans in June took place before His Highness the Rajah at Simanggang on the 4th. August.
This tribal feud has been existent for a great many years
and, though the Ulu Ai surrendered to (Government at Lubok Antu in 1909 after a series of expeditions had been lend against them for many years previously, their mutual enmity with these tribes had never been settled, as raids on the Ulu Layer in 1914, and Ulu Skrang in 1915, by the Ulu Ai Dayaks, and on the Delok by the Skrang in 1916 bear witness.
Attempts have been made previously to effect a settlement but have always failed owing to the extravagant demands of the Ulu Ais.
At the meeting at Krangan Telaus on 3rd. June however, after the Mepi. Meniang, Delok and Jingin had been visited by the A. D. O., Mr. J. A. H. Hardie, with a number of Pengulus from down-river, the Saribas and Kaluka, an agreement was reached whereby the Ulu Batang Ais should hand over 20 and the Engkaris 10 benaga jars to the Skrangs, Layers and Lemanaks, which tribes in turn would each give them 10 benaga jars in exchange. Thereby the honour of both sides was very simply satisfied.
This custom amongst Dayaks dates from time immemorial and is known as the palit mata sapu moa literally to dry the eyes and wipe the face, " meaning that, once this exchange has been effected, all grief for those killed in the feud is assuaged. No Dayak peace has ever been lasting without this ceremony, as so many pig-killings bear testimony. The jars exchanged are kept in the houses of the headmen of the respective tribes as tangible tokens ' of the settlement of the feud. At the lime of the ceremony of exchanging these jars, terrible curses are uttered by the chief headman of either side on whoso should at any future date reopen the feud by taking the head of an aforetime enemy.
One can only hope that such tokens of peace maybe of more value than many an European Scrap of Paper," such as that torn up on the same day six years ago.

" Ingat, ingat kita semua pesan jako aku.
" Tu ikas jmo aku."
Penghulu Unji of the: Ulu Layer and Penghulu Kana of the Delok. chosen by their respective people, then proceeded with the sampi, or oath, as to the settlement, of till their blood-feuds. The latter bears die marks of nine snider bullet wounds, received in encounters with the Government forces at various times. Having called on all their gods to witness this compact, Penghulu Labang of the Ulu Skrang and Penghulu Apai Laja of the Engkari, father of Kana, proceeded to kill the two pigs, one. for each side, by striking through the gullet with a spear. This ceremony being satisfactorily completed, the Ulu Ais removed across to the down-river side and the Skrangs, Layers and Lemanaks took their places on the up-river side of the flagstaff; and, as in turn their names were called by the A. D. O, the chiefs on each side proceeded to carry off the jars presented to them by their late enemies.
Finally His Highness the Rajah called the three up-river and three down-river chiefs, named in his speech, to the Dais to receive from His Highness' hands the chanang each as a token of the ratification of their peace-making and to the other two intermediary chiefs were then presented each the spear, kuna, and pua as signs, according to ancient Dayak custom, that the spirit of strife amongst which they have lived has been finally quietened.
This ceremony being over, each chieftain in turn pledged the others health in a bowl of tuak.
His Highness, before leaving, mingled with the crowd of Dayaks, who positively surged round to shake hands.
For the benefit of those unacquainted with the Dayak tongue, the following is a free translation of His Highness' speech :
"Thus have I come here to witness all you people of the upper river Skrang. Layer and Lemanak make- peace by the killing of pigs and the exchange of jars as a sign of having buried all your past enmities. And so, in days gone by. did my father " witness the peace-making Irei ween the Balau, Undup and Skrang tribes, since when they have ever lived in peace ami-good will one with another.
And, to this day, every race under my rule has such signs of good-faith from their aforetime enemies."
"Now that all you of the upper river have settled "the blood feud with the tribes of the Skrang, Layer and Lemanak, you recognise how all are of the same stock, and have no further cause for dispute, honour having been satisfied on both sides by the settlement at the Telaus meeting-place, and the blood of a pig having been spilled to testify to this.
But I have come here to ratify that compact, as I am like a father with his children, my sole desire being that all should live in peace and friendliness one with another, and all countries lie open, that you may all gain in prosperity by the cultivation of the soil, and trading one with another in the produce of your forests.
A Pavilion, decorated in the Sarawak colours, bud
been erected on the plain for the ceremony, and long before the hour fixed for this crowds of Dayaks started to arrive. Natives from all over the 2nd. Division had been pouring in for days previously, and accommodation m the kampongs and bazaar was at a premium.
The Rangers, forming a hollow square, guarded the roped-off enclosure in front of the pavilion. Before this lay the 30 Ulu Ai and Engkari benaga jars on the up-river side of the flagstaff which flew His flightless' flag, on the down-river side of which were placed the 30 benaga jars from the Skrang, Layer unit Lemanak. Grouped round their respective jars were the chieftains of these tribes in their full war costume, actual brass hats but hornbill and argus pheasant befeathered and coats of the fur of the tree-tiger, bear-skin and the scales of the teat fish, decorated alike with streamers of hair taken from the scalps of their aforetime victims; while certain down-river Penghulus, who have long since discarded the trappings of war, provided a contrast in their uniforms of the yellow-braided black coat with red zouave trousers, set off by the Sarawak head-dress and a yellow sash.
Shortly after 9 o'clock. His Highness the Rajah arrived from the Astana, escorted by the A D. O., Mr. J. A. H. Hardie, with Datu Haji Tamin, Abang Haji Buasan and Abang Dul.
The chieftains of the tribes having been collected before the Dais, His Highness proceeded to address them as follows, the whole company standing.
"Nyadi baka aku datai ditu ka med a kita menoa Ulu Batang Ai enggau Skrang serta Layer enggau Lemanak bebunoh babi lalu besileh tajau ka palit main ka sapu moa. Nyadi ari kalia, apai aku, Rajah tuai, udah ga ngemata ka Balau serta undup palit mala enggau Skrang. Nadai kala sida bunoh sama diri udah nya.

The out-put (gross) for the month was 2,314.11 tons. 465 tons of this was consumed by our boilers, and 1,849.11 tons delivered to the wharf.
The shipments for the month were as follows:
The Kuching Municipality ...	... 394.11 tons.
Messrs. The Borneo Company Ltd., Kuching 728.01
.. Sarawak Steamship Co.,. . 382.00 .. Soon Seng & Co., Sibu	... 166.00
Total 1,620.12 ton.,.
Production figures were above the average for previous months and the exports were about equal. Stocks on the wharf at the end of the month totalled 228.19 tons.
The workings in the denuded area situated to the cast of No. 9 mine were worked at a high pressure. The west-side workings of No. 8 mine struck gob during the latter part of the month and the panel sections of the upper scum workings are now rapidly approaching the north crop.
Mr. James Jones, mechanical engineer arrived to do duty at the Collieries accompanied by myself
Therefore I desire to speak to you all this day, all you chiefs gathered together here from the upper and lower rivers. Make sure to remember my words.
The oaths which you will utter according to your own custom this day, I confirm with my word that, should anyone reopen this feud at any future day that man shall become my sworn enemy, and I shall demand the life of anyone who so lakes the life of another. In the past your blood-feud has been recognised, but from now henceforth this no longer exists having been finally settled this day before me by the blood of these pigs and the exchange of those jars.
Therefore I now give, as a token of my word, to you of the upper river three chanangs to cover those jars which are to be held by Penghulu Apai Laja, Penghulu Kana and Penghulu Jamit, so that these may be kept by you as a sign of my ratification of this settlement evident to your children and all future generations.
Likewise you men of the lower rivers, remember my words, and as u pledge of these, I cover those jars to be held by Penghulu Labang in the Skrang, Penghulu Unji in the Layer and Penghulu Suel in the Lemanak each with a chanang.
And, you Penghulu Taping and Chendan I present with a spear, kuna, and pua, to hand on from generation to generation as a seal from myself that the spirit of strife between these tribes of which, though you have lived amidst, neither has been a party, has now been finally laid at rest,
Remember my words, all you chiefs."
I have spoken.
The Vandals.
We thought it was Necessity"
The Thing that knows no law
That took away our Bandstand
And killed our flowers galore.
The tamils came in hundreds
They piled on earth (and glass)
They levelled off the hillocks
And finished off with grass
We often remonstrated.
We hear the answer still
"How can we train a police force
If theyve nowhere they can drill."
This silenced all our protests
In pain we looked around
But now the work's completed Its only a football ground !
They occupied the girls' school,
Then the Rajahs stables went.
Pig Lane has it barracks.
Their eyes on Mosque Road bent.
n
Their grasping hand's upon us
Their Vandal's greed commenced
So take my tip you landlords
And keep your acres fenced.

per s. s. Alice Lorraine on the 18th. I left again for Singapore in order to recruit labour on the 23rd., and was still away at the end of the month.
Everything went well in the mechanical department and at the wharf, and the rainfall for the month was 322 inches only.

SIMANGGANG.
July.
Mr. W. F. Dick visited Engkilili.from the 2nd. to the 4th., and Lingga and Sebuyow from the 16th. to the 19th., the latter being in connection with investigations into certain alleged breaches of the Rice and Padi Regulations by the bazaar Chinese.
Abang Haji Buasan was sent to Kuching on the 5th. for medical attention, having been ill ever since returning from the Ulu Ai in the beginning of last mouth. He returned here in s. l. Mermaid on 28th., having made a most satisfactory recovery.
The long sentence prisoner Voon Shak, who escaped from gaol on the 5th. May, was recaptured by Ahet, a Susor Senggang Malay, on his way to catch up the bandongs at Lingga on the 7th. instant. Voon Shak received the customary punishment. $50 reward was paid to Ahet. From his condition I do not think Voon Shak could have received much assistance locally; and, no doubt, the thefts at Sabu may be attributed to him.
Several Dayaks suspected of leprosy, in the Skrang, Sari has and Undup districts, were sent down to Kuching for medical examination ; I much regret to report that this disesae appears to be spreading rapidly, and breaks out in the most unexpected quarters. Formerly it was confined to the Ulu Spak and Layer, where those suffering were segregated in the Tegrungan stream.
Chon, a young Dayak girl of Kaong in the Skrang, was killed by a crocodile on the 20th. Talip of Sadoug, the professional catcher, has been at work in the district during the month, and has reported four kills, one a proved man-eater of over 17 feet in length.
Lim Boo's house at Lubok Enggris, Engkilili, was burnt to the ground in the night of the 18th., and damage estimated at $2,000 done.
Messrs. E. H. Haldane and 8. L. Strike arrived from Sadong in m. 1. Eros on the 22nd. and left for Kalaka and Rejang on the 24th.
The Lingga birds-nests farm were obtained by Lim Ah Quee on a tender of $1,112 for one year, an increase of $132 on the last rental.
Tim Ah Lok, prisoner sentenced to three months at Roban on 3rd. May. died from dysentery on the 27th. This has been somewhat prevalent lately.
Court---An enquiry into the death of the Bakong Malay, Abong, from the felling of a sago palm, exonerated everyone concerned from responsibility, but the Malay employing him at the time agreed to pay a certain sum to the mosque for religious observances on behalf of the deceased.
Hew Lee San, a Chinese physician, was sentenced to four months for contributing to the death of a child by negligence in administering a drug of which he did not know the proper use. The medicine used was composed of tuba noting. Compensation was paid to the adopted parents of the child.
Ngantin, Sabu Chinese, was sentenced to a further six months for theft of clothing from the dhobi's house.
Other convictions include Medun, Sebuyow Malay, three months for theft, Kim Look, silversmith, four months for absconding under advances and breach
of trust, two other bazaar silversmiths Ah Sam mid Ah Hok, being fined for abetment; Chee Sai, three months for living, and selling trading goods, in a Dayak house; Tan Ah Yam, silversmith, fined $100 for breach of Order No: XXIV, 1917. Elijah and Mut, brothers, were again before the Court for armed assault, and further heavy penalties were imposed and fresh security required for their future behaviour. Land cases from the Undup, Balau, Skrang and Sari has also took up a lot of my time. These, and fruit tree disputes, are undoubtedly productive of more perjury than anything else.
Saribas.A fire occurred in the night of the 31st. at the back of the Belong bazaar, resulting in the total destruction of Queh Ang Ahs arrack godown. An invalid Chinaman was burnt to death; but, most fortunately, owing to their being no wind at the time, it was possible to prevent the fire spreading to the main bazaar buildings. The origin of the fire is the subject of an enquiry.
Kalaka Chua Beng Tek, having absconded, the security of $1 000 deposited in May in connection with the case brought against him and Man by the latters husband Jaoyah, was forfeited. It is reported that Chua Beng Tek got away in the kotak boat No. 108 to Sambas, and the whole affair was undoubtedly arranged by his relatives in Kabong, who had supplied the above security.

Court. ---There have been but few cases before the Courts during the month and none of any importance.
Public Works. -The prison gang have been rebuilding the bazaar road and this should be finished next month. Their work has been interrupted by various other work which they bad to do or it. would have been finished this month. All the timber and attaps for the new barracks had to be carried to the new site and this took up a considerable part of their time, and they also carried and stacked a large quantity of planks for the Government.
The Tamils have repaired the Kampong Hilir road and have weeded the centre of the Race Course road which was already gravelled but hail been allowed to go to grass.
The work of this gang has been very satisfactory. So far the contractor has made good progress with the new barracks which however were not completed as I hail hoped owing to delays due to non delivery timber and attaps but August will see them finished and occupied.
The whole of the outside of the Sibu bazaar has been whitewashed by the owners of the shop-houses and this has created a vast improvement in the general appearance of the place. Repairs to the shops are also being effected where necessary.
General.The rice mill and ice plant at Sibu was purchased by the Government and has been running satisfactorily. The supply of padi is far greater than the mill can handle ana I am trying to make arrange-

The s. s Alice Lorraine left for Kuching on the 1st. with over a quarter of a million in cash for the Kuching Treasury. She came in again on the 9th. with buffaloes and on the 17th, on the last occasion sailing for Bintulu next day to load timber for Kuching.

I left for Kuching in H. H. Y. Zahora with Messrs. Carpenter. Bruce and Cotterill for Kuching. Mr. Cotterill has been transferred from the Sibu to the Miri Treasury and left to take up his new appointment.
Malays, Dayaks and Chinese have been busy
farming and I trust the acreage cleared will exceed that of last year. The weather has been intensely hot mid dry mid Chinese burnt off most of their farming land but the Malays and Dayaks farming hilly ground will not be burning their clearings for some time yet, probably till late in September.
I received a message from the Leppu Tau chief Tama Lawi to the effect that he intended paying Sibu a visit later nn in the year when the padi had been plantedprobably October.
A Chinese, Lee Ho, who had been sentenced at Sibu on the 10th. to 18 months R. I. for burglary at Dalat managed to commit suicide the same day by
jumping into the river. The body was recovered on the 12th. near the saw-mill.

CourtThere were no cases of importance before the Court this month.
During my absence in Kuching two prisoners were implicated in stealing Government. rice, one of them escaping from irons. He was recaptured later that day however, and both will lie duly dealt with.
P. W. D.Requests for tenders, regarding erection of new police barracks for this district, being unsuccessful locally, they were issued by the Resident 3rd. Division at Sibu. No tenders, however, have been submitted as yet.
A row of unused tumble-down shop-houses adjoining the bazaar were ordered to be demolished. Four out of the eight doors have been reconstructed by the owners.
The house of the 2nd. clerk, Oya, has also been rewalled with new kajangs and repaired inside.
The undergrowth on several large areas near the kuala, has been burned, and the land prepared for padi planting.
Prisoners have been kept busy on the roads and Government grounds, and a few employed making paddles for the long time.
At Penat, a wide path from the kampong to the kuala has now been completed
Food Control- Only 735 gantangs wore sold ex- Government rice store, a very considerable decrease from previous, months, as would be expected just now.

BINTULU
July.
Court.Cases before the Court related mainly to disputes about jelutong roads and sago lands. An inheritance case, Savas vs: Limah, adjourned from the previous month owing to the ill health of the latter, was settled by agreement.
P. W. D. The prison gang, averaging five men, was engaged on the kampong roads, the ornamental grounds and some necessary repairs to the police barracks. Channel marks, swept away by a storm, were replaced.
Tatau. I visited this station with Datu Haji Abdullah on the 12th. returning here on the 20th. A large number of Dayak cases were heard, the more important were concerned with felling jelutong trees and setting pig-traps I spent two days in Sungni Atiap at the house of Penghulu Bunya.
While at Tatau two Chinese junks called for bilian. I understand they were unable to find sufficient and proposed to call at Lundu to complete their cargoes.
About 400 passus of padi, bought from Dayaks were stored in the police barracks as no other accommodation could be found. The rest should be delivered by the end of the month. I hope to make arrangements to bring part of this to Bintulu, where the harvest has been poor.
General. Pte. Mangkol, who has been ill during the hut two months, was sent back to headquarters. An explosion of a charge in a muzzle-loading gun caused certain injuries to Pte. Dampa which fortunately have not proved serious.
A tuba fishing was held in Sungei Sebiau by Kampung Klajat and I understand some large fish were secured, though not until twelve hours after the poison had been put in.
Opium handed over for safe-keeping was given to the agent appointed by the farm.
Rainfall for the month amounted to 6 22 inches.

Mr. H. S. B. Johnson who is retiring from the Government Service, handed over to me the affairs of the district on the 1st. Mr. Johnson who left for Kuching by the Adeh on the 10th. has been most popular with everyone here. On the eve of his departure the bazaar was profusely decorated and illuminated, and a very successful entertainment was given in his honour.

P. W. D.An examination of the reservoir showed there was a bad leak in the dam. This has been stopped temporarily, a more permanent job will be made of it when the cement arrives from Kuching. Much of the upper section of the pipe line, which is the older, is in a very precarious state and it is impossible to say how much longer it will last.
The whitewashing and tarring of Government buildings was begun this month.
A mass of jungle growth on the north-east side of the District Officer's bungalow, which was blocking out air and light, has been cut away.
The Damit was put on the stocks and all her old paint and varnish scraped off. She will be repainted after the new outlet has been fixed.

BROOKETON COLLIERY.
July.
The gross out-put of coal amounted to 1,925.75 tons, 537.5 tons was consumed by our boilers and the balance 1,388.25 tons was sent to wharf.
We shipped 1,576 tons coal to Labuan and supplied to p. s. Adeh and local launches 141 tons.
Coal in stock at the end of the month was 16.75 tons only.
Sales at Labuan amounted to 1,212 tons, 1,135 tons of which was taken by Messrs, the Straits Steamship Company's steamers.
There were still a number of the mine coolies suffering from influenza in the early part of the month but I am pleased to say that before the end of the month this complaint had practically disappeared.
In the North Drive there are now very few coal working faces and consequently the out-put from this mine is low. The reason for this is, that out of the eleven levels opened out in this mine five only, are producing coal, the other six having been driven to the end of the seam on the south side and having reached the old workings of the West Slant on the north side. Unfortunately owing to insufficient steam power, we shall be unable to drive the main shaft down much deeper than it is at present and until we are able to increase our steam power, I regret the out-put from this mine will continue to be low, as we shall lie unable to extend the present workings.
Owing to difficulties with the air compressor engine two pumps in the main deep of the North Drive were under water from the middle to the end of the month, otherwise everything else in the mechanical department went smoothly.
The s. l. L'Aubaine was beached for survey on the 16th. Her boiler was tested with the result that it

are comparatively few, so that it is hardly worth while employing tappers, whereas tenting them out a larger profit will accrue.
The Adeh made three trips this month conveying 138 buffaloes to Kuching. On the last occasion, owing to the drought, she went up to Mengatai for fresh water.
The Peter Duff also called in four times.
