SATURDAY, JANUARY 1926.
Death
His Highness the Rajah has heard with deep regret of
the death of Mr. Q, A. Buck, formerly Resident of Sibu, who
died at Newton Abbot, Devonshire, on the 21st November,
1925. aged 73.
With the year barely completed, and with no
annual Report Statistics yet available for com-
parison, one can but briefly summarise the events
of interest which have transpired during 1925.
H.M. Submarines L.19, Lieut -Commander C. R.
Thompson, and L.15, Lieut. W. L. Berridge, visit-
ed Kuching in January. Exhibition dives were
attempted opposite the Workshop but un-
fortunately it was found to shallow to submerge
completely.
In February, His Highness the Rajah left for
Europe, having appointed His Highness the Tuan
Muda, who arrived in Kuching in May, to ad- minister the Government of the State until his re-
turn in November. The Malay and Chinese Com-
munities in Kuching gave the Rajah and his
family a great reception, and particular welcome
was accorded to Her Highness the Ranee, who
had made a wonderful recovery after a very
serious illness.
After thirty-five years of faithful service, Datu
Haji Mohamed Ali, Datu Temonggong, died on
the 21st March, aged 75 years The late Datu, a
typical Malay gentleman of the old school, was
an authority on the customary laws or adat of the
Sarawak people, and his loss was deeply felt.
April 15th, 1925 was the first anniversary of the
foundation of the Sarawak Association, formed
under the patronage of His Highness the Rajah
and the presidency of His Highness the Tuan
Muda. The membership now totals well over
one hundred.
July heralded the first anniversary of the Go-vernment control of Opium Monopoly, which in- cluded. The registration of opium smokers, the
closing down of numerous retail shops and their
replacement by a few Government divans, which
was accomplished with a minimum of opposition
and difficulty, thanks to the co-operation of the
Chinese themselves. A Chinese Advisory Com-
mittee has been formed, and it is confidently
hoped that this will lead to an even closer
effective control in the future.
The country has been free from any epidemics
except for several rather serious outbreaks of
smallpox which caused many deaths in various
districts, notably Bintulu, Mukah, Upper Rejang
and Saribas.
The services of a Government Dental Surgeon,
acquired for Sarawak through the co-operation of
2
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, JANUARY 2, 1926.
the British North Borneo Government, have proved a welcome innovation.
A further stride of progress was marked in July when aerial survey was undertaken in Sarawak territory for the first time. Important work was carried but for Messrs. The Sarawak Oilfields, Ltd , and the Government, in Northern Sarawak and part of Brunei, aerial photography being used to a great extent. Government has also contracted for an aerial photographic survey of the Rejang Delta, which should be completed in 1926.
Progress in Wireless installation has been steady. There are now eleven stations in operation, and arrangements are well in hand for the erection of five more. Their reliability and efficiency compared with erstwhile jungle communications has been demonstrated repeatedly.
His Highness the Rajah's birthday in September was the occasion of the presentation of Long Service Medals and Decorations to those Government servants who had twenty-one years meritorious service. There were over one hundred recipients of this honour.
Towards the end of the year, owing to a steady rise in the price of rubber, which at one time touched 4s. 6d. per lb., was the cause of a rapid increase in the Immigration figures for Chinese labour, especially to the Third Division, where there are now large agricultural colonies of Chinese. It was therefore' decided to institute a more organised control, and with this object in view, certain areas have been subdivided and appropriately demarcated for the sole occupation of Chinese agriculturists, mostly rubber planters, under respective Chinese headmen
This step will at once allay any anxiety on the part of neighbouring native farmers, who may have feared uncontrolled encroachment and penetration into their preserves.
The Public Works Department, have been
working at full pressure throughout the year, and
undertaken the erection of many new permanent I
works including P. W. D. Offices and Store; extension of Government Printing Office, which is now in charge of a fully qualified European
Printer.
The construction of the new General Hospital and of the new Sarawak Club on the Golf Course
is in the hands of a Singapore contractor. A further three miles of the railway has been com-
pleted
The R. C. Mission is to be congratulated upon
the erection of a large and very substantially built Convent at Kuching, which was opened by His
Highness the Tuan Muda in October.
Another worthy institution was commenced by
the local Chinese community, who have guar-
anteed sufficient funds for the erection and main-tenance of a Pauper Camp. The work is being
undertaken by the Public Works Department.
Generally speaking, one may say that 1925 has
been a year of increasing contentment and pros-
perity accompanied by progressive strides both
in trade and administration, the benefits of which
cannot fail to assure the State continued peace
and credit.
NOTES.
(December)
WE wish our readers the Compliments of the
Season and the best of luck during 1926.
THEIR Highnesses the Rajah and Ranee were
accorded a rousing reception on the night of the
2nd December, by the populace living across
river.
Inchi Abu Bakar, Awang Omar, Ampuan Haji
Narudin, Ali bin Sapar and Mohamat bin Kadir,
were responsible for the illuminations on a vast
scale, of Kampongs Boyan Lama, Gersek, Soura-
baya. Penglima Seman, and Pulo, covering a
distance of some two miles.
The proceedings commenced about 9p.m, under
conditions which could not-have been more plea-
sant and picturesque. Her Highness the Ranee,
borne shoulder high in a decorated Sedan chair,
and flanked by a party of military torch bearers,
headed the procession, which included His High-
ness the Rajah accompanied by the Chief
Secretary, the Dayang Leonora, Elizabeth and
Vava, together with a small party of Europeans,
and a trail of enthusiastic villagers.
An incessant accompaniment of bombs and
crackers swelling the chorus of cheers, marked
the progress of the ever increasing column, which
could be seen wending its tortuous way under a
pall of smoke, which drifted away lazily through
the overhanging coconut palms, silhouetted
against a bright moon.
A halt was called at the entrance to Kampong
Gersek, while Her Highness the Ranee transferred
to a canopied seat in a gaily decorated vehicle
representing a Bandong Ikan. The three Dayang
were seated with Her Highness.
The party then continued its way through
innumerable illuminated arches of unique design
to Kampong Sourabaya, where special rickshaws
were waiting to carry Their Highnesses along the
remaining distance to be covered.
During the return journey, an invitation was
accepted to enter the house of Inchi Abu Bakar,
where light refreshments were served.
After receiving a loyal and well-phrased address
of welcome, Her Highness the Ranee, the Dayang
Leonora, Elizabeth and Vava, were each pre-
seated with a pair of beautifully wrought bangles
of pure Sekrang gold specially made by Towkay
Ah Boo of Chop Hin Ann. His Highness the
Rajah, in a brief reply, heartily thanked all those
responsible for these stirring manifestations of
welcome.
THEIR Highnesses the Rajah and Ranee paid a
short visit to Bau on the 7th, the new Astana
being used for the first time.
His Highness the Rajah left Kuching per
s.s Rajah of Sarawak on the 16th in order to visit
the Third Division. Mr Ed. Parnell and Capt.
C. D. Le Gros Clark accompanied His Highness.
THEIR Highnesses the Rajah and Ranee were
entertained at dinner by Mr. Chan Kee Ong at
his residence on the night of the 15th December
The grounds were tastefully illuminated with a
variety of coloured electric lights There were
also present Major and Mrs. Cunynghame, Messrs.
Rennie and Parnell, the Datu Bandar and Inche
Abu Bakar The band of the Sarawak Rangers
rendered selections of music.
WE wish the Dayang Vava many happy returns
of the 20th December, her 10th birthday.
H.H the Tuan Muda arrived in England via
Marseilles on the 9th December.
WE much regret to hear of the death of Juragan
Ali at Baram on the 14th December. Although
in failing health he continued in Government
service to the end. He leaves behind him a fine
record of some 40 years loyal and devoted service;
ever fearless and untiring in his work, Sarawak
can ill afford to lose men of his type, the best of
the old school.

Sarawak Museum Journal.
After a lapse of some nine years the publication
of another number of the Sarawak Museum Journal
is very' welcome. The first number of the Journal
appeared in 1911 and was followed by five other
numbers before the war put an effective brake on
the publication of scientific journals in most parts
of the world. Number 7 of our Museum Journal
however, was produced in 1917. Number 8, dated
December 1925, has now appeared, indicating we
hope, that the series will be continued regularly
as before.
As reading matter the new Number will prove
extremely indigestible to the general public. That
is, however, to be regarded as the true hall-mark
of a scientific publication. The papers in this
number are contributed by various scientists,
well-known as specialists in their respective branches of zoology. Two new forms of birds are described, one by Dr. Hartert, the well-known ornithologist, whose studies at Lord Rothschild's Museum at Tring have earned him a world-wide reputation. Dr. Malcolm Smith, who until his recent retirement to England, was one of the principal supporters of the Siam Natural History Society, and a recognized authority on Malayan reptiles, describes some new reptiles and amphibia from the Sarawak Museum collections.
Several important papers on comparatively little studied groups of insects fill the greater part of the number. Thus Dr. Karny of the Buitenzorg Museum writes on katydids ; Dr. Hanitsch, formerly Director of the Baffles Museum, Singapore, describes twenty-four new cockroaches from the Sarawak Museum. He notes that the number of different species of these somewhat unpopular insects now recorded from Borneo is no less than 146. Dr. Schott contributes a paper on Collembola, a neglected group of minute wingless insects.
The material described in these papers was collected by Dr. Mjoberg, the late Curator of the

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, JANUARY 2, 1926.
Sarawak Museum, who specialized in collecting specimens of these obscure and seldom studied groups of insects. Thanks to his collecting energies, and to the studies of specialists working on his collections, many interesting additions to the Fauna of Borneo are now made known.
The Sarawak Museum Journal by no means confines itself to unreadable scientific papers. In earlier numbers, interesting papers were contributed by Officers of the Sarawak Government Service, and by others resident in Sarawak, dealing with native customs and beliefs, local dialects and folklore. Journeys in Borneo formed the subject of other papers ; while contributions to our knowledge of the Botany and Geology of Borneo also appeared.
It is understood that the Curator has received several more papers for publication. We feel sure that the reappearance of this Museum Journal will be welcomed by scientific institutions at home and abroad. It only remains to add that the Journal in printing and arrangement is a credit alike to the Editor and to the Printer. Some excellent plates, including one coloured, add to the value of the new number.

Proud chieftain, long ago, who warred In ignorance against the tide of fate, Look down into your country now And see the braves, who, years before in hate, Now prosperous, content, and wiser far, Cut fat and slender rubber trees a rate.
Instead of blood, the sap that runs is white. Instead of heads, the braves take home, they say A string of silver dollars that make a night More joyful and more merrier than those That welcomed home the trophies of the fight.

Yet in his dreams the spiders leap and shout, Lobsters flash and glistening dutch wives beud, The bed moves fasterpink elephants in rout. He jumps about and foremost in the sway Seeks out the largest longest toe.
A look of pride, the fist upraised to slay A gasp, a gurgle, and instead of blow The Sarawakian passes out anew And wakes . . a head two aspirins . . streuth !!

The Lake District.*
An enthusiastic welcome awaited Their High- nesses the Rajah and Ranee, together with the Dayang Leonora, Elizabeth and Vava, who, attended by the A.D.C , Captain Barry Gifford, visited Bau from the 7th to the 9th December. A display of fireworks and a lantern procession were arranged, and attracted large crowds.
This is the first time that the new Astana at Bau has been occupied. We are informed that from the edge of the lake, one of the most attractive views in the country is obtained, while excellent bathing and a certain amount of fishing is procurable.
The party returned to Kuching by car, the journey taking about one and a half hours. There remain only a few miles of road surface to be conditioned at this end, and when this is done it should be possible to visit the "lake district." enjoy a bathe and return to Kuching in an afternoon.
Buying Elephants in Burma.
Both elephants and teak are indigenous to Burma, and with the invaluable assistance of the former, the latter is shipped in large quantities to all parts of the world.
Thousands of elephants are kept hard at work during the rainy season pushing and hauling huge baulks of timber into the rapidly swelling nul-
lahs, where they are first formed into rafts, and then started on their journey to the saw-mills in many cases hundreds of miles distant.
From time to time it becomes necessary to replenish or increase the stock of elephants, and an experienced jungle-wallah" is deputed for this responsible task.
Like the horse, an elephant has good and bad points, and as the price of a partly trained worker ranges from 200 to 600 it is evident that great care and experience are essential in making the purchases.
The condition of the skin, the girth, height shape and length of legs, and tusks (if a male) must all be carefully weighed up, and it is advisable always to examine carefully for old brand marks, for some of the elephants brought by the wilv Siamese for sale have sometimes strayed from their camps, been requisitioned and passed off as newly-captured and trained from the wild.
Gangs of Dacoits still abound in Burma, and many Europeans have lost their lives at the hands of these outlaws while on an elephant buying expedition.
In the first place, a Burmese broker arranges with the vendors (in many cases Siamese jungle-wallahs) a suitable spot for the Thakin or Sahib to see the elephants at work in order that he may gain some idea as to how far they have been trained. This done, the Thakin starts off on his journey from headquarters with a considerable sum of money in silver (rupees) packed tightly into numerous wooden boxes. The reason for carrying the money in this way is that the average elephant merchant does not understand paper money and will not accept it accordingly. Dacoits are continually on the look-out for opportunities of this kind, and although military police guards are furnished in some districts the money has repeatedly been stolen and the Thakins murdered.
On arrival at the pre-arranged spot---usually a clearing in the jungle outside a small village--- the Thakin views the animals whose points he approves of, at work ; and after a certain amount
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, JANUARY 2, 1926.
of bargaining a price is arranged and paid out forthwith, much to the relief of the Thakin as he sees his stack of rupees dwindling rapidly away.
Perhaps some ten or more new workers are acquired in this way, and the next move is to see them branded, and started on the march to the scene of their future activities
These extraordinary animals exhibit signs of considerable trepidation at the idea of being branded, but the process is not a painful one, and they very soon regain their composure, on being permitted to roam a while before they are prepared for marching.
Elephants are not marched during the heat of the day, but the journey is accomplished in early morning and evening stages. On occasions a serious obstacle in the shape of a river comes in the way of the march, and neither persuasion nor driving will induce our friends, usually so partial to water, to swim to the opposite bank. The services of a steam launch have then to be requisitioned in order to overcome this difficulty, and the elephants are forthwith marched to a part of the river where the near bank is steep and the opposite side shelving. They are then led one by one to the edge of the steep bank, their forelegs fettered near the feet, and a stout line made fast round the fetter at one end, and to the stern of the launch at the other. The signal is then given for full speed ahead on the launch, and after a few moments' terrific resistance the elephant has to give way and is hauled unceremoniously head over heels into the deep water below him. He is then towed with only just the tip of his trunk visible above water until he finds his feet on the opposite shelving bank. A driver then swims from the launch to the elephants neck, and perched thereon, drives him, hobbled, out of the water. The process is repeated with No 2, who, with the others, has been kept well in the background, and so on until all are safely across. This rough and ready method has been in vogue for many years in Burma, and there is a part of the Salween River rather above the village of Shwaygun, which has been the scene of many such operations. On very rare occasions the tow rope has been known to part, and the fettered elephant carried away down stream and eventually drowned.
In cases where eight or ten elephants have to be transported in the manner described, the whole day is usually given to the task, and once across the still fettered animals are allowed to roam and feed at will, while their respective drivers gather together and discuss the days work
The Thakin having issued final instructions to the drivers, now retires to the nearest bungalow after a trying, but none the less satisfactory, time, and having disposed of his numerous boxes of rupees, he "turns in for the night and forgets his revolver.
On the following morning before the dawn breaks there is great activity in the drivers camp and a general round-up of the straying elephants commences. The drivers disappear, and one by one they return with their respective charges, who are by this time unfettered and concentrated at a given spot ready for the next stages of the march.
The sweet scent of the golden Padouk, and the fascinating fragrance of the early morning in tropical Burma are never to be forgotten, and an elephant-buying expedition is one on which these experiences are intermingled with a feeling of intense excitement, responsibility, and finally relief.

On December 9th Her Highness the Ranee visited the School, and on arrival was presented with a basket of flowers by Miss Hazel Ellis.
The Rt. Rev. The Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak, in the Chair, welcomed the Ranee on her visit to the School, and mentioned the new Government Educational policy, by which the School benefitted, and that owing to this, new buildings, badly needed, would be proceeded with as soon as labour and materials were available.
The Headmaster, Mr. A. N. Ellis, in the course of his report, mentioned that the number on the registers at the end of November was 482, of which 129 were boarders.
The Chief Secretary emphasised the value of games, and the desire of the Government that the schools of Sarawak should produce good citizens.
Her Highness then presented the prizes given by His Highness the Rajah.
The Archdeacon of Sarawak, having proposed a vote of thanks to Her Highness, the proceedings terminated with three hearty cheers.

Kuching Sports.
To
The Editor,
Sarawak Gazette,
Kuching
SIR,
As Secretary to the Committee of His Highness the Rajahs Birthday Sports, I wish through the medium of your paper to endeavour to put Inquisitive's doubts at rest.
It appears to be rather obvious that Inquisitive took no further interest in the Sports than consulting the programme, for had he done so he would have realized that the names contained therein were finally arrived at after several heats had been run off.
The heats were drawn up at a meeting of School masters representing each school which was held in Mr. W. T. Kebles house at the S.P.G. on the 20th September. All the entry forms were laid before the meeting and I feel sure that Inquisitive will agree that had any one school exceeded its 2% entry, the representatives of the other schools present would have most certainly had something to say in the matter. As far as possible one competitor from each school was entered in every heat, and these were run off in the usual manner. Thus on the actual day of the Sports only the best athletes in Kuching were competing, which explains why some schools had more finalists than others.
It is usual to award the Victor Ludorum on points gained in flat races and jumps only, therefore no points were given for the potato race which is only a side event and incidently is a race open to any boy whether he be under four feet in height or only eligible to enter for open events.
The suggestion that only ten boys from each School should be entered would make no difference whatever to the final result, for naturally each school would put up their best ten men just as they now enter their best 2% in fact it would only mean a slight reduction in the number of heats to be run off.
In passing I would mention that if Inquisitive is not yet satisfied, at any time he cares to come to my Office I shall be delighted to show him the original entry I forms and results of heats, etc., etc.
Yours faithfully,
S. T. ENNION, Honorary Secretary. Club Notes.
The New Amalgamated Club.
?	The following is a summary of a meeting held in The Sarawak Club by the temporary Committee of the Amalgamated Club, at 6.30 p.m., on 20th November, 1925.
It was decided that Sub-Committees should be appointed to put forward suggestions in connection with the formation of the new Amalgamated Club, and that such Committees will only be temporary, pending the occupation of the Amalgamated Club.
1. (a) Tennis--it was decided that Messrs. H. D. Aplin, J. P. Baird and R. D. Binnie should be asked to supervise the construction of the six new tennis courts, the estimate being $4,800 for surfacing and enclosing these courts.
(b) Golf Messrs. Bean and Lang consent to put forward their proposals with regard to all matters concerned with golfing conditions.
(c) Bowls.It was decided that Messrs. G. T. Bates and Captain A. S. Lowe, M.C., should be asked to make all necessary arrangements as to the construction, etc., of the new bowling alley.
(d) Housing. It was decided that Mrs. Aplin and Mrs. Fenwick should be asked to help to make all necessary arrangements in connection with the housing of the new Amalgamated Club, in conjunction with Major S. Cunynghame and Mr. J. S. W. Bean, who have kindly consented to help ; and that they should have the power to ask for any further assistance. The estimated allowance for this work being, as per Circular dated the 7th September, 1925, $5,000.
(e) New Rules.It was decided that Messrs. A. E. Lawrence and H. M. Calvert should be asked to draw up the necessary rules for the new Amalgamated Club.
The following extra Sub-Committee was then agreed to :-
(f) Grounds and Garden It was decided that Messrs J. P. Mead and E. S. Holl should be asked to make arrangements as to the approach to the new Club, paths, hedges and garden.
2. With regard to raising debentures, it was decided that this proposal should be brought up at a later date.
3. It was proposed and carried, that the three Honorary Secretaries of the three Clubs now in existence, shall form a Financial Committee and that they shall report to the present Committee the financial position of each Club (i.e., the Sarawak Club, the New Club, and the Golf Club), as soon after the close of the present year as possible.
4. It was agreed that all matters affecting all property of the three Clubs must be referred to the amalgamated Committee.
5. The selection of an Honorary Secretary and Honorary Treasurer was discussed, and must be again considered at a later date, as this proposition is one of considerable difficulty.
6. The proposal of the erection of two Squash Racquet Courts was agreed to, provided private subscriptions could be raised amounting to, approximately, the sum of $1,000.
All those nominated to serve on the various Sub-Committees have kindly consented ; Captain C. P. Lowe taking the place of Captain A. S. Lowe who unfortunately is suffering from indisposition.
Any suggestions will be welcomed by the members of these Sub-Committees.

Number eight and nine Mines produced an
average output, and there was a slight improvement
in conditions obtaining below ground at the Upper
Seam and the New Mines respectively, which re-
flected satisfactorily on output.
The surveillance continued in connection with
the previous month's reported unrest among our
Malay Workshop apprentices, Malay carpenters,
etc., provided conclusive evidence that the beginning
of the trouble was coincident with the arrival in this
district, from Sibu, of one Lau Jee Thai in Sep-
tember, A letter signed by this man under date
9th October, 1925, to one of our senior apprentices,
in which promises of cash advances and alluring
rates of wages were made, was produced and placed
before the Divisional Officer during his visit here
on the 17th, accompanied by the Officer-in-Charge
of the District,
This has had the desired result, and there is no
further trouble to be expected in this connection.
The Rainfall for the month was 19.19 inches.

Native Officer Haji Mohidin was then sent up country to make farther inquiries, he returned a week later with many more of these chits; and Penghulus luting and Sana who accompanied him confirmed the fact that the majority of their followers had paid tax to ex-Corporal Sa'at, and had accepted these imitation receipts as genuine, Corporal Saat having been the authorised Dyak tax collector for the last few years Certain Dyaks had also foolishly given Saat sums of money to purchase guns for them. Few of these payments have been credited in the books and the guns are not forthcoming. Ex-Corporal Saat has since been convicted of criminal breach of trust and cheating and duly sentenced to a term of imprisonment in Kuching Gaol
The Tua Kampong of Bunut, Haji Husin, was heavily fined for breach of the Quarantine Regulations. Sun Wai Ho was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for assaulting and wounding Pun Ho Chiang.
Serudin bin Tunkal was convicted of cheating, and sentenced to six months imprisonment; Serahil (f.) was fined for breach of the Quarantine Regulations; Demong, Dyak was imprisoned for three months for evading payment of door tax during the last few years.
In the case of Wee Choon (f.) widow of the Manager (deceased) of Chop Seng Moh vs. Tan Chin Seng the charge of breach of agreement was dismissed. Wee Choon (f.) I understand intends to appeal; she claims that the Kuching creditors had no right to order the auctioning and public winding of the Estate of Chop Seng Moh (deceased) although the liabilities are far in excess of the assets.
A Dyak inheritance case, Lunas vs. Abas, which has been outstanding for a number of years was finally settled, the four jars in dispute reverting to Government.
The appeal of Ma Lock against the decision of the District Court, Dalat, was heard at Dalat on the 30th, and the original judgment upheld.
Court was held at Balingian on the 17th and 19th the majority of cases being Breach of Agreement to work jangle produce, and ordinary trade debts; there are still numbers of debt cases outstanding as these could not be dealt with owing to the defendants being away in the jungle at the time of my visit.
One Haji Daud was fined for interfering with the local administration of the District. Kho Chu Inn, Foochow Chin- se, was sentenced to one month's imprisonment at Balingian for theft of timber.
GeneralI. left for Balingian in the m.l. Leonora on the 16th accompanied by Datu Awang Udin ; all available Court work was attended to, and a new Mohammedan Tua Kampong, one Ahmat Sanai, and a Pagan Tua Kampong, one Bengai, appointed three months probation. The local police were brought up to established strength, and instructions left for the Court Writer regarding their duties, etc A trip was made to Kuala Lemai, six hours up-river, in the m.l. Leonora and a number of Dyak rubber plantations visited. Penghulu Mulok also reported himself, and informed me that the majority of the local Dyaks, chiefly Saribas, were planting rubber on the-hilly ground around their houses but that the swamps were being reserved for padi. At present most of the population is away tapping jelutong which appears to be the chief product of the District. The Chinese community applied for better trade facilities, especially a Wireless Telegraph Station, as they are so cut off during the monsoons; they also requested that a suitable light be erected at the river mouth in order to assist schooners entering the river at night. The Court Writer's house will shortly need rebuilding, and the paths around the station are in a very bad condition. I returned to Mukah on the 20th, and left for Oya by bicycle on the 28th. 1 was still away at the end of the month.
Agriculture Native Officer, Abang Haji Mohidin. completed his inspection of local rubber gardens, and is now compiling a record of all such plantations for possible taxation. Sago gardens and coconut groves are not being inspected at the moment as the owners have never paid any kind of tax on such cultivation to date.
Occupation tickets under the Land Order of 1920 are now being issued to all persons desirous of clearing virgin jungle for the planting of either rubber or sago.
Staff The District Officer, Mr, P. M. Adams came over from Oya on horseback on the 5th to discuss the 1926 Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure, he left again on the 7th.
The Native Officers, Datu Awang Udin, and Abang Haji Mohidin, returned from Kuching on the 3rd. Tambik, the Clerk of Dalat, also reported his return from leave in Kuching, and requested permission to remain at Mukah a few weeks in order to study the new method of accounting.
Abang Haji Mohidin left for the interior on the 13th in order to collect evidence regarding the defalcations in the Dyak Tax returns. He returned on the 22nd accompanied by Peughulus Inting and Sana.
Court Writer F. Ansin reported his return to duty at Balingian on the 20th, and Clerk W. Chua Tambi returned from temporary duty at Balingian on the 24th, Police Sergeant Serudin, having retired on pension, the local force has been thoroughly re-organised under Corporal Yahya and Lance-Corporal Idi, and brought up to full established strength.

Public Works.The carpenters were employed fitting french windows to the verandah of the European Bungalow.
The prison gang averaging 11 men whitewashed the new Police Barracks, and worked on the general upkeep of the Government Grounds. The Tamil gang cleated the outlying roads, and then assisted the waterworks staff in laying the pipe-lines.
Captain A. S. Lowe arrived on the 3rd to supervise progress on the waterworks which has, I understand, been considerably delayed by t.ie non arrival of certain tank parts.

The District Officer, Mr. P. M. Adams, reports as follows
CourtVery few cases brought for settlement and none call for special comment. An appeal brought by Ma Lock against a conviction for house trespass by night was dismissed.
Travelling Dalat was visited twice during the month, from 9th to 16th, and again from 20th to 30th. I went to Mukah on the 5th and discussed the annual estimates with the Divisional Officer, returning on the 7th with the potties. I visited Penat and Judan to inspect and alienate land taken up for cultivation of sago and rubber.
Land.Several applications were received to plant rubber some of which have been granted after inspection of the land when it has appeared that for some reason or other that sago will not grow properly. In all other cases rubber planting has been discouraged in the Oya river. The greatest number of applications came from Igan and the Tua Kampong has been given instructions to deal with them, a d prepare the way for survey later on. A surveyor has been applied for.
Staff Tambik, the clerk; of Dalat, returned from leave at the end of the month, after having spent most of his leave in the Treasury, Kuching, and at Mukah studying the new system of accounts. As soon as the arrears of clerical work have been written up, the other clerks will be granted leave in turn This means we shall continue to be understaffed.
General I returned from Kuching by s.s. Sulong on the 3rd. Nothing of importance had occurred during tnv absence
Several old unsigned and undelivered registered documents were discovered at Dalat, also letters, including registered articles, which were either undelivered or never posted. This has been inquired into and cleared up. Communication from the sea has been difficult, owing to rough seas.
P.W.D The clerk's house at Dalat was repaired. The Dalat natives were called out to work timber required for the new Court House at Oya, and a certain amount of belian posts were delivered by Dyaks,
More attaps have been ordered from Bintulu, and it is hoped a start can be made on the new Court House early next year, if a suitable carpenter can be found.
A well was sunk at the new clerk's quarters, the timbers from another well which is never used, being transferred to the new one.
Prison Prisoners averaged IL

Mr. H. H. Kortright, District Officer of Bintulu, reports as follows: Courts.There has been a fair amount of Court work during the month. One, Avan, a Puan from Tatau, wanted for nearly three years was at last caught. This man was originally wanted for some petty offence but would not come down. He evaded those sent to take him and finally armed himself and resisted arrest. Later he was captured at Belaga but escaped and again armed himself. He had for some time terrorised other 1unans who were afraid to go near him, and it was only by trickery that he was eventually caught. He was convicted on three charges and sentenced in all to three years imprisonment and 12 strokes with the rattan.
A very unusual gambling case was brought before the District Court when three Chinese from Kuching, who were running a Chap Jee Kee hoard, were caught cheating. A member of the local Gambling Farm being suspicious of the consistent winning of the visiting gamblers, snatched the bag containing the dominoes and dominoe box ; the owners ran away and hid themselves. The contents of the bag were examined and it was found that the domino box had been fitted with a false top and contained two dominoes instead of one. There were actually two in it when examined. Cards used during the game, and others in defendants possession were also found to have been marked. Nam Seng, who was the owner of the outfit, was sentenced to one year and was fined $200, under section 417 Penal Code, and his two accomplices were sentenced to 6 months and fined $25 each.
Other cases before the Courts were---Land cases Breach of Agreement, Contempt of Court, Assault, and 6 Dyaks were fined for obtaining a pass to travel under false pretences.
P.W.DThe prison gang averaging 22.08 has finished clearing the cuttle ground, and has been employed ditching and repairing damage done to roads, etc., by the heavy rains. Prisoners have also completed the alterations in the Fort and these have made a great improvement to the interior of the Fort, besides allowing decent room in the various offices. A contract has been let for $300 to build a house for the Native Officer at Tatau. This building should be finished and occupied by the end of the year.
TravellingI left Bintuiu on the 15th to visit the sub stations in this river and hired a local motor launch for the trip Two days were spent at Sebauh and while there I marked out the site Tor a new bazaar. Fifteen lots with an eighteen foot frontage and an 18' fire gap between every three shops were measured out. Eight of these sites were immediately taken and when I returned the framework of one building was already up The shops are all to be of uniform size, height and design.
There was very little Court work, everybody being away on their farms.
All weights and measures were verified, as this work had not yet been done this year.
One, Kleh, was appointed Tuah Kampong of Sebauh subject to the approval of His Highness the Rajah. This man has been acting in this capacity for some time.
One night was spent at Pandan. Here one, Kee Yaw, was fined $25 for being in possession of a false daching, the latter being confiscated.
Two hours were spent at Labang and the few weights and measures there verified.
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, JANUARY 2, 1926.

At Tubau there was a. good deal of work as the tax for the current year had not yet been collected, weights and measures again to be done and there were a great many cases of debt, and other petty cases brought before the Court. A very long standing dispute between two Kayan houses concerning Kayan Custom and etiquette was at last satisfactorily settled. In connection with this one Madang Wan was unanimously elected to be Tuah of Rumah Paku, and Yat Liling retired and moved to Pengbulu Passus house.
hive Chinese Hawkers were ordered out of the Kabulu and Penan Kampongs. These men were not living in the native houses, but had built leaf attap -houses for themselves. However several of them were very unpopular with the natives, probably on account of their shady methods of trading, and it was considered advisable to order them buck to the Tubau Bazaar.
Three days were spent al Tubau, and leaving there at daylight on the 21st I arrived at Bintulu the same evening.
AgricultureKayans and Penans are all late with
their farms, and are now only just planting, whereas Dyak and Native padi is well up. In spite of a very long kemarau very few of these people, burnt off their farms, and were only starting this when the rain came, as a result very few got good burns. Their excuse for being late is that they always burn in the 7th Chinese month, but that this year the 4th Chinese mouth came twice, and so they are a month late with everything.
Constant exhortations to natives to plant up sago lands have apparently at last taken effect. In the neighbourhood of Sebauh, a great deal of sago land has recently been planted up, old gardens are being enlarged, properly cleared and replanted. The export of raw sago should steadily increase from now on, and in from seven to ten years there should be a large export of this commodity from this river.
HealthI regret to say the health of the District has been distinctly bad. When I left on September 19th to attend Race Week in Kuching there were only two eases of smallpox in the Isolation Camp, when I returned on October the 3rd, there were thirteen and on the 15th of the month there were thirty-three cases in the Camp and two deaths had occurred in the Kampong. The total number of deaths so far are as follows: ten persons in the Isolation Camp, five in the Kampongs and four in farming huts in the jungle where many ran and hid themselves to avoid being isolated. At the end of the month there were twelve cases left in the Camp and as far as was known no cases had occurred since the 15th. At Pandan there have been two cases, and one death. Cases having been concealed is the reason for the excessive spread of this disease and it became necessary to make a house to house search every day. Great difficulty was experienced with the natives, who did everything possible to evade being isolated, some tried to refuse to be moved, others moved and returned to their homes again during the night. The Tua Kampongs behaved very badly, and not in one single instance did they report an illness in their kampongs. The Natives Officers were little better, and never rendered any voluntary assistance. The one bright spot was the very devoted work of Benjamin Franklin the Dresser in Charge. At one period he was working twelve and fourteen hours a day, and I cannot speak too highly of his work and the cheerful manner in which he did it. The total number of vaccinations done in the Bintulu River is 4,027 and 602 in the Tatau
Dresser Senada was sent from Sibu and was sent up both rivers, but 95% of the Dyaks in the district flatly refused to be vaccinated.
General	I returned from Kuching by s.s. Sulong
on the 3rd.
Mr. F. J. Wright, Forest Ranger Special Class, was transferred to Sjbu and left by s.s. Sulong on the 10th. I understand that no one is taking his place for the present, and so the clerk Joon Choy is in charge of the Forest Department work in this District.
Mr. E. Banks, Curator of the Sarawak Museum,arrived by m.s. Muaratebas on the 12th on a collecting trip. He accompanied me on a visit to the sub-stations between the 15th ana 21st and went to Kidurong on the 29th and was still there at the end of the month.
Mr. P. Down, Accountant of the Wireless Department, arrived by m.s. Eng Hap Leong on the 29th, to start the new method of accounts in this District. He was still here at the end of the month.
Trade.Trade has been very good, jelutong has been bought for 15.50 per picul and raw sago at $2.20 per passu. Belian attaps are in great demand at present and 441,700 have been shipped during the month. The local price is now $85 per laksa. This I consider extremely high for the class of attaps now worked and an effort is being made to improve the quality of all belian attaps made in this river.
The Trade Returns for the month are as follows:
1925.	1924.
Imports $59,016.88	$25,123.00
Exports ...	53,981.62	29,693.15

Mr. Sampson proceeded to Niah and Sibuti on the 7th returning on the 12th having walked along the coast from Sibuti. The Kadayan padi farms are reported to be very promising. The Government buildings at Niah are in very bad condition. Extensive repairs will be necessary next year and have been allowed for in the Estimates.
The L'Aubaine arrived on the 23rd with a new squad of Rangers, returning to Kuching the following day.
Very heavy rain fell on the night of the 27th causing considerable damage to roads and bridges.
A drowning accident occurred on the 13th; Kwong Fah, a Chinese water carrier, was crossing the river at night in a small boat with two companions when the boat capsized and he was drowned. The body was recovered the following day.
Tenders for the Miri Pawn Farm (the present lease expiring at the end of the current year) were received and forwarded to the Controller, Government Monopolies. Tenders show a considerable increase.
Among the visitors-who landed at Miri during the month were Mr. E. E. Pretty, British Resident, Brunei, Messrs. Pollard, Corson, A.C.F., and J. Anderson, Cadet.
P.W.D.-Various construction work in hand was continued. An expenditure of $2,000 was sanctioned for asphalting the surface of the road from the offices to the foot of Maori Hill and this work has been commenced.
Health Suleiman continued vaccination in the Division and has vaccinated 2,038 to date, including 900 at Sibuti. 837 at Niah, and 301 between Bungai and Luak. Of the 12 smallpox cases reported at Suai, four have died.

Many cases settled in Probate and Bankruptcy Courts.
Fines and fees amounted to $901.31.
General .Some of the newly-arrived Foochow, j
Chinese were reported out of work owing to their not working properly. The custom here is to divide the I
amount of rubber obtained equally between owner and tapper, the scrap reverting to the latter. It was found they were obtaining nearly all scrap and very little of
the real article. A meeting was held and they were all informed that if they continued this no one would em-
ploy them. Instructions as to future working were clearly given. There are about 25 to 30 of these people
of the same tribe who will only tap rubber and refuse to work at ditching or clearing. The remainder are setting down and have already applied for 600 acres of land to plant rubber but this was not grafted. They were in- formed that for every acre they clear for rubber they
must clear a like amount tor planting padi. sago or other
foodstuffs. They eventually agreed to this and have
started clearing land in Poyut which has been allotted
to them and, when finished, this will be measured and
divided up in the correct proportions.
Tama Ukat Plian, Long Bersungei Chief, arrived from
the Tinjar and paid in outstanding fines.
Captain Gaskell of the Aerial Survey Company, Mirj,
arrived by seaplane on the 12th instant and was unable
to return until the following day owing to magneto
trouble.
Many Kayans arrived down from upriver seeking em-
ployment until their padi is ripe for harvesting and
obtained work immediately clearing and ditching rubber
gardens.
The Biah Dyaks, Bakong, complain that the Malang
Dyaks are encroaching on their land. They were ordered to report the matter to Penghulu Rhu.
An inventory of all Government furniture and crockery
was taken and a copy sent to Superintendent of Stores.
The crockery is very antiquated and should be replaced
with new.
Penghulu Tama Tingang arrived from the Tutau with
wood for sale to Messrs. Sarawak Oilfields, Ltd., Bakong.
Penghulu Lanting paid a visit and was sent to Poyut
to settle any outstanding cases.
The lamplighter in the bazaar met with a serious accident while pumping up the air tank of one of the street lamps which exploded and fractured bis skull.
P. C. Seman and Corporal Rebi granted 15 days' leave each.
E. Hunt, clerk, arrived to do duty for Thiam Jiew who left for Miri some time ago.
I left for upriver by s.l. La Follette accompanied by T. Mohamed, Native Officer. All houses in Baram and Tutau as far as Long Palai and Batu Blah were visited and all outstanding cases settled. I was away from- 26th instant to 29th instant.
Galan, Upriver Agent, and P. C. Hassan of Lio Matu arrived with Paa Trap Kalabits who are bringing down one of their followers, Akon, who killed a Brian of N J. Territory in the Paa Trap house at the end of last year, Penghulu Tama Wan Bayer also came down at request of the Kalabits.
Three new long boats were received from upriver for visiting purposes these being made by Kayans of Uma Bawang, Long Kalimau and Long Tabungau.
Agriculture.The padi upriver is very good and promising but in the Bakong amongst the Dyaks practically all has been killed by insects.
Rainfall was 660 inches.
Medical Dresser Kim Cheng returned from vaccinating in Bakong and reports only two small houses refused to be done. All Chinese and Malays have been vaccinated and the upriver people as far as Long Palai in Baram, Batu Blah in Tatau, and Long Tru in Tinjar.
Forestry. Many rafts of timber arrived from upriver for The Sarawak Oilfield, Limited, Sawmill, Bakong.
I
The price of jelutong in the bazaar during the month was $13 to $13.50 per picul, but no one will work this
produce, owing to the new regulations of Forestry Department. As this will cause great inconvenience to the Trade of the District, instructions were given to Forest Clerk, Forester and Forest Guards to inform all those desirous of working this produce that they may follow the old regulations until the arrival of Assistant Conservator of Forests when the matter will be brought before him. There are only 556 piculs in fences at the present time against 2,604 piculs for the same period last year,
Trade and Shipping.Juragan Muntil and Engineer Labeh of s.l. La Follette were granted one months leave each. The whole of the crew have signed on for next year with the exception of the Jerumudi and two sailors.

October, 1925.
The Acting Assistant District Officer reports as follows:
Court.In the Magistrate's Court Achang was sentenced to nine months for theft and Adu to two months for abetment; Kechil one mouth for travelling without a pass; Dullah bin Bakir was fined $10 for felling timber in the proposed Kayangaran Forest Reserve and Ingu and Tai Palong $10 each under section 160; Usin and and Rabun were fined $10 and $20 for illicit gambling.
Prisoners. The average number of prisoners -during the month was nine. They were employed in repairing the syce's quarters and re-attaping the stables. Three were employed at Trusan collecting stones for the cement work.
Public Works.The contract for cementing below the Fort at Trusan was signed by Vong Kiau and the work put in hand at once. The other contractor, Vong Chun, is asking a ridiculous price for the repairs to the Police quarters at Trusan, and I have now sent for Raman who, though an inferior work, man, is far more reasonable. It is a matter of some difficulty to get good workmen in this district, and Vong Chun seems to think that he has the monopoly and can therefore ask any price he likes.
Travelling.I returned to Limbang from Kuching on the 5th, leaving next for Lawas where the clerk reported all well. On the 12th I walked to Sualai where I settled a boundary dispute and also inquired into the complaints against Ah Kam who leases the Kedayans rubber gardens. I stayed the night with Haji Taha, the Tua Kampong, and next morning went on to Punang by boat. From Punang I walked along the shore to Melipat and thence back to Lawas. On the 15th I went round to Trusan by launch to superintend the changing of the guard of Rangers. I returned to Lawas on the 17th.
Agriculture The Lawas (Sarawak) Rubber Estates, Ltd., exported 34,320 lbs. of dry rubber to Labuan during the month.
Military.The new squad of Rangers under L.-Cpl. Layang arrived by s.s. Auby, the old squad under L.-Cpl. Ubam returning to Kuching by the same steamer.
Shipping.--On the 18th, Captain Macphail of s.s. Auby came over from Limbang in m.l. Sylvia to see if it would be possible for his ship to come up as far as the bazaar. On account of the shallow water at Tanjong Melabing, this is impossible, but she will come up as far as Kuala Kayangaran on her next trip. All the bazaar traders seem pleased at the idea and. with direct shipments, it may now be possible for the Vamco Timber Company to attack the Singapore market.
S.L. Daisy made one trip to load bark for the Island Trading Company and m.l. Nancy made one trip to Labuan. She has now been replaced by the tongkang Sri Vamco as she is now fit to run in the landas.
