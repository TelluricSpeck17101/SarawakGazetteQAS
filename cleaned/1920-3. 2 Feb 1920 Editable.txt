he was allowed to return home and rejoin his old regiment, the Middlesex, in which he had previously held a commission ; within a month of his arrival in England he was in the Ypres salient where he was gassed and wounded on the last day of the second battle of Ypres. On recovery he joined the Royal Flying Corps, obtaining his wings in June 1916 as a pusher Scout Pilot. He was kept at home instructing until October when he again saw service on the Somme, being in the patrol which brought down the German ace Boelke.
Capt. Gilford was then transferred to German East Africa for bombing and reconnaissance, flying from Dar-es-Salaam to Portuguese East Africa until the Germans were driven out of their country and the campaign was practically at an end. He was then transferred to Egypt and remained as an instructor supplying all Eastern fronts with artillery observation pilots. He was twice mentioned in despatches for distinguished service in the field.

S. S. Kuching left for Singapore on the 23rd with passengers the Rev. Father Jansen and Messrs. E. Parnell and Lim Chai Heng.
THE Manager of the Government Printing Office would be obliged if officers ordering printed forms would not send orders for large stocks at one time. Orders sent every three months, sufficient for that period, will enable him to fill orders more quickly and also help to distribute the work more evenly through the year. At present owing to increased work orders for large quantities are being cut down.
Miri Notes.
?
The Christmas and New Year festivities started on December 24th when a football match took place between the Sarawak-born clerks and those born in Singapore. A fast and well contested game ended in a win for Sarawak by 2 goals to 1.
A service was held in the Court house on Christmas Day at 8.30 a. m. which was attended by some forty persons. A collection for the Miri Church
Fund realised some $50.
A series of contests between the Government and
Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company, Limited, were
played.
The football match, which was held on 27th, was
the pice de resistance and after a scrambling game the Government, who had the assistance of Messrs. Adams and Andreini, from Baram, managed to win by 1 to ml. Mr. Adams, Soon Siew and Abeng were most prominent in the forward line the latter's centres from outside right being quite a feature, whilst P. C. Rebi played a splendid game at back, whilst Mr. Taylor and Chua Beng played a hard and strenuous game for the Company.
A return match was played on January 3rd but again the Company's team, although strengthened by more European players, were beaten by 1 goal to nil. The score hardly represents the game, which was very fast, but after the first ten minutes the Company were never really dangerous, and if it had not been for the wonderful display of their goal-keeper, would certainly have suffered a more severe defeat. The combination of the Government team was much superior.
Mr. Adams and his right wing again signalised themselves, whilst Tiam Jiew and Eng Soon played
a sturdy game at back Messrs. Taylor, Blake and Blackmore worked hard in the Company's attack and Mr. Taylor senior was a tower of strength in the defence.
On Sunday 28th a golf match was played, which
was won by the Company by 3J to Mrs. Douglas being the only Government player who didnt lose, although she played the gentlemen's course. The
scores were:
Company.	Government.
() Major Benjamin and () Mrs. Douglas. All square.
(1) Mr. G. It. Thomas beat (0) Honble. R. S. Douglas by 1 up.
(1) Capt. L. H. Dennis ,, (0) Mr. C. D. Adam ,, 3 (1) Mr. C. McAlpine ,, (0) Mr. E. V. Andreini ,, 8 ,,
On the following Sunday a foursomes match took place which ended all square. Messrs. Douglas and Adams beat Messrs. Thomas and Dennis by 4 up, whilst Messrs Benjamin and McAlpine beat Mrs. Douglas and Mr. Andreini by 3 up.
The tennis doubles took place on 30th and the Government won by 2 to 1. The best of 15 games was played.
Messrs. Andreini and Adams beat Messrs. Benjamin and Head 87.
Messrs. Skrine and Kortright beat Messrs. Foster- Smith and Brooks 85.
Rouble. R. S. ami Mrs. Douglas lost to Messrs. Blake and Taylor 48.
A singles match was arranged on New Years Day, but the Company's team failed to put in an appearance through some misunderstanding.
On Christmas Day Master Peter Douglas had a Children's party and Christmas Tree al the Residency and a number of ladies and gentlemen partook
m
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, FEBRUARY 2, 1920.

of tea and refreshments in a marquee erected in the grounds and afterwards joined in games with children. The Christmas tree elicited the usual exclamations of delight from everybody and was a great success.
Dinner parties were the order of the week and one began to.hear the usual groans about late nights from the hardworking community, but the Bing Boys from Baram kept things merry and bright from start to finish.
On New Years Eve an entertainment was given at the Miri Club at which dancing and singing was kept up till 2 am. A certain amount of new talent was discovered, whilst an impromptu jazz band was loudly encored for its efforts.
Our heartiest congratulations to Mr. and Mrs. Kortright who had a son born to them on December 2nd; we hear that mother and child are both doing well.
On January 1st H.M.S Margion Commander Dawson R. N. arrived from Singapore followed on the 4th by H. M. Tanker Khaki Lieut. Gattey R. N. R. These are the first ships of the British Navy that have been seen here for many a long day and we hope that we shall see more of them in the future.
It is rumoured that the A. S. Pet. Co. are shortly going to start motor lorries in Miri and the roads me being made up to carry this heavy traffic. Certainly the change of management has hustled things up greatly in Miri. It is seldom now that a day passes without an oil-tanker being in port loading liquid fuel or benzine.(Contributed.)
Clippings.
?
The Varsity boat race has been fixed for March 27th.(P. G.)
A considerable number of cases of influenza are reported in Penang at present. The Medical Department at Home, gives the following advice regarding the disease. Infection is by contact, coughing, sneezing, and even loud talking. The poison can be projected ns far as 10 feet, from the infected host in this manner, and draughts and air currents can also carry. Hence the importance of overcrowding, or wearing masks in crowded places. The period of incubation before the signs show themselves is said to be 48 hours, or even less. Among measures of personal protection are well ventilated rooms, healthy living, avoidance of excess, including alcoholic excess, avoidance of crowded gatherings, warm clothes, and a wash for throat and nostrils (one teaspoonful of common salt to a pint of warm water with a few crystals of permanganate of potash addedenough to make the solution pink. This may be used as a gargle and wash). In the sick room masks should of course be worn, and the memorandum advises that goggles should also be employed to protect the eyes. The mask, of gauze or butter muslin, should cover both nose and mouth. The patient must go to bed at once, and must avoid chills and overexertion during convalescence. Expectoration should be received into a glazed receptacle into which chloride of lime has been put. The attendants should wash their hands after each contact with the patient. (P. G.)
Marriage of Abang Sibawaihi and
Dayang Enayah.
?
On January 23rd25th a marriage of local importance was celebrated when Abang Sibawaihi bin Datu Haji Azhari was wedded to Dayang Enayah binti Data Hakim Haji Azahari, at the same time festivities for the coming of age of Abang Buli bin Haji Suhaili and Abang Abih bin Abang Haji Osman were held.
On the 23rd the ceremony of hanging the curtains" was performed at the Datu Hakim's bouse. At this function the benediction was read by the Tuan Bilal, Haji Arip, after which the guests partook of the good things provided for them. All arrangements on behalf of the Datu Hakim were undertaken by Haji Suhaili and Abang Matdaan. Friday night was given up to merry-making and on Saturday the bridegroom and the two boys went in procession to the Datu Hakims house where the marriage service was solemnized by Haji Nawawi, the Datu Imaum. Afterwards the bride held her court in her father's bouse, while the bridegroom and the two boys were at home at the house of Datu Haji Azahari. The masters of the ceremonies here were Abang Haji Osman and Mohamed Hamit. Feasting took place at both houses.
On Sunday the 25th, at 2 p.m., the procession of Abang Buli and Abang Abih began. Abang Haji Hepni came from Abang Suleiman's house and read the service at the Datu Hakim's house in the preseuce of a large gathering. A further feast took place at both houses after which all the women, but old and young, escorted the bridegroom from his fathers house to that of his prospective father-in-law. At four oclock the bridegroom, having been adorned by Abang Rawi, and his two companions were conveyed in procession along the Datu's Road, a little later Her Highness the Ranee and children with the Tuan Muda arrived with other distinguished guests, the bridegroom then entered the house of the bride and together they sat in state and under went the ceremony of being sprinkled with yellow rice.
During the three days the Rangers and Inche Alis bands were in attendance. In conclusion it is to be noted that the successful arrangement of cars and flags were due to the kind assistance of Abang Suleiman and Abang Haji Fadil.(Translated.)

Prices at Outstations.

The Editor,
Sarawak Gazette.
DEAR SIR,
Lucky residents at Mukah having to pay only 55 cents per kuti for fowls! I am told the price in Kuching is only something near about $1 per kati.
36 THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, FEBRUARY 2, 1920.
The other prices mentioned in the Mukah report for October 1919 just published are about the same as in Kuching.
Yours in bankruptcy,
KUCHING RESIDENT.
High Prices.
?
The Editor,
Sarawak Gazette.
DEAR SIR.
Old Bird appears to think that such a store as I suggested could not possibly be run on any system but one in which credit would have to be given. Of course that would prevent goods being sold at reasonable rates.
But could not intending customers be asked to deposit a minimum of say $25 against their purchase of goods when they would be supplied up to that amount, a further deposit being made when the first was exhausted?
Surely there could be no reasonable objection to such a system. If "Old Bird" knows of one I should lie glad to hear of it?
I am, dear Sir,
Yours faithfully,
JOB.
The Sarawak Regatta.
?
The Editor,
Sarawak Gazette.
DEAR SIR,
I was interested to read your account of the annual regatta held at Kuching on the 1st., but do not consider it,an impartial report.
You say that the late arrival of the Simanggang boats caused some inconvenience to the committee, but do not mention the fact that a local boat entered after them; incidentally 1 might remark that the Sri Kinawang was entered some weeks before the regatta.
You make the very sweeping statement that the Dalat Melano fully justified the opinion that they are the best paddlers and boat builders in the country they certainly proved themselves to be first-class paddlers, but no more so than the Simanggang crews, and as the two people have never raced against each other under equal conditions, your statement is decidedly premature. You will perhaps say that the races won by the Simanggang boats were not such brilliant finishes as those won by the Dalat Melano, but take the success of the Sarawak Rangers a boat with a mixed crew, of which over 60% were paddlers from the Sri Kinawang, this was as brilliant, if not more so, than the Dalat Melano successes, considering that the boat came in last in a previous race, while in this race they had the outer bend of the river, and the Simanggang paddlers had won two strenuous races earlier in the day.
As regards the Dalat Melano being the best boat builders, this has not been proved, and judging by the remarks overheard on the course, the Simanggang boats were easily the most admired, both for workmanship and lines.
In conclusion I might remark that the type of boat used by the Dalat Melano is similar to those used almost daily here for riding the bore. I hope it will be possible for the two people to meet under equal conditions next year, which would settle all argument as to their respective merits.
I am, dear Sir,
Yours faithfully,
OWNER.
MONTHLY REPORTS.
UPPER SARAWAK.
BAU AND PAKU .
?
December, 1919.
Court.A number of cases. mostly of a trivial nature, were before the Courts during the month. Those that are worth mentioning are: Sejit, an Empro Dayak, sentenced to twelve months imprisonment for causing the death of Sanyas by sheeting rashly.
Sitam was sent to gaol for three months for fraud, Sirat for selling Government rice in the bazaar; Leong Nyuk for selling the Company's rice in the bazaar; Bakar for theft and Jong Tuk and Lai Tsin for theft of rubber, and eleven Malay boatmen of the Sarawak Rubber Estates, Ltd., for breach of contract.
Hong Hap Foh was fined for being in possession of an unregistered datching and Rembia for fishing with tuba without permission.
There were also a few civil claims deal with.
Public Works.The prison gang completed the raising of the road from the police barracks to the bazaar and started the extension towards Buan. They also cleared the Buan road and removed several heavy landslips that took place after heavy rain there.
The Court Writers house was patched up and made more or less watertight and was cleaned up as much as its rotten state would permit, and the new clerk moved in there on arrival from Kuching. A new house will shortly be dhicted to take its place.
As pigs were being killed at Siniawan in a number of places in the bazaar I arranged to build a slaughter house on an approved site below the shops and as soon as it is completed to let the pork farm to a Chinese at a monthly rental as is done at Bau. A few months rent will pay for the building which should be completed next month and the farm will then be let.
Heavy downpours of rain in the course of the month made a horrible mess of the un-metalled paths which will want repair when the fine weather comes again.
A number of floor beams in the bungalow were found to be in a rotten state as also were some of the planks and these were replaced.
General.Mr. Mead, Conservator of Forests, accompanied by Mrs. Mead paid a short visit to Bau on the 6th. A site for a Forest Clearing Station was selected not far from the Court house.
Another Dayak shooting case occurred at Empro (Left Hand Brunch) a pig drive was in progress when Sejit shot a relative of his named Sanyas in the back killing him instantly. Sejit saw the long grass waving and simply fired into it on the chance of these being a pig there without waiting to see what he was shooting at with this unfortunate result. The Court sentenced him to a year imprisonment.
A fatal accident took place on the mine on the 9th. A coolie working at the foot of the main incline hitching waggons on to the endless wire rope failed to hitch one properly so that after travelling a few yards up the incline it broke loose and running backwards caught the man just as he had turned his back to the incline to bitch on another waggon. Death was instantaneous.
On the 16th instructions were received from Kuching at 11 a.m. to raise the price of opium to $5.40 a tael. Stocks of opium in the various shops were immediately checked and opium was being sold at the enhanced price by midday throughout the district.
The pork farmer ceased to kill pigs on the 18th as he said that he could not sell at the controlled price
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, FEBRUARY 2, 1920.
37
owing to the high price of live pigs, viz: $51 per picul. The Food Controller was communicated with and later on the control was removed temporarily. As a result the price of No. 1 grade pork rose from 62 to 72 cents per kati at which level it has since remained. The farmer tried to buy pigs from the Dayaks to kill until the matter was settled, but the Dayaks, hearing that the Chinese were asking such a high price for their live swine, promptly refused to sell except at their price though their animals are far inferior beasts to those of the Chinese breeders.
I went to Dahan Estate on the 23rd returning on the 26th whilst there I noticed that the Javanese coolies have successfully started their irrigated padi on ground selected for the purpose and are working it in their spare time with slight assistance from the management, and it is only owing to the shortage of labour on the estate that the area opened up is not much larger, but what padi has been planted appears to be doing well. It is to be hoped that a larger area will be opened and that the natives may be induced to follow the lead given if the results prove to be what they should.
Many of the Javanese possess flourishing vegetable gardens on the estate and have also planted quantities of bandong and krebang. All these gardens are well looked after by their owners. At the invitation of the Manager I inspected the plots which cover a considerable area in order to decide which ones were to be awarded the prizes offered by the management.
Some months ago a Siniawan Chinese applied for a grant of swamp land which he proposed to irrigate and put under padi, but when he proposed to start operations the Serambo Dayaks stepped in and claimed the land saying they intended planting it up at once though .they have never done so before. They then cleared a small corner ami planted padi but did no more than prevent the Chinese from doing so. The resultant padi is excellent, but the procedure is typical of the Land Dayak. He cannot or will not plant himself and prevents anyone else from doing so.
A Chinese was drowned at Lida Tanah on the 25th while attempting to swim out to a sampan in which his wife was adrift. The river was swollen and the man was unable to swim at all.
At 4 a. m. on the 30th Joo Hengs rubber factory on his garden at Batu Kitang was robbed of 200 sheets of rubber and his mandor Chee Kok, who pursued the robbers, was speared and killed by one of them. The matter has already been fully reported on.
Large quantities of sheet and scrap rubber are being stolen every month and the thefts are increasing and, as in this case, are being carried out boldly and in a most determined manner. If a limited number of dealers were licensed to purchase rubber in each district a brake would be applied to this. At present anyone can steal and easily dispose of rubber even if marked, as it was in Joo Heng's ease, as small traders buy rubber without troubling to enquire into its origin and to trace it is difficult, if not impossible.
Licensed dealers could be watched carefully and no one would be able to purchase, as they do at present. Something should be done in the matter, and if such thefts did not entirely cease at any rate they could be made more difficult to carry out and probably profitless.
The out-put from the Cyaniding Works amounted to gold 124.1 ozs. and silver 323.6 ozs.
The rainfall for the month was 17'97 inches.

Resident.
SADONG COLLIERY.

December, 1919.
The gross out-put of coal for the month was 1,806 tons, 465 tons of this were consumed by our boilers and 1,341 tons were delivered to the wharf for export.
The shipments for the month were:
To The Kuching Municipality ... 246.07 tons
Messrs. The Borneo Co., Ltd.	876.03	,,	Sarawak Steamship Co. ...	288.16 ,,
,,	British Malaysian Maufg.	Co.	4.00	,,
,,	Soon Seng & Co., Sibu	...	128.00	,,
Total Shipments 1,543.06 tons
Progress was rather slow on the work around the fall in No. 8 mine on account of bad ground and the inside workings of this and No. 9 mine were unapproachable owing to the foul and gassy condition of the air.
The upper seam mine produced well and a portion of this seam on the north crop was worked off on the open-cast method, in order to make tip for the temporarily decreased out-put from the lower seam.
The railway line was further extended and the jungle land on either side was cleared and planted up with padi.
A belian house in course of construction was blown down by wind early in the month. There was a good deal of rain, the total rainfall for the month being 2348 inches.
The damage caused by Kapang and the strong tides on the down-river end of the wharf has been repaired. The up-river end now appears to be gradually sinking and will require a good deal of attention during the present monsoon weather.
I left for Kuching on the 18th and returned again on the 23rd with Mr. David Evans who had arrived by the Singapore steamer the previous evening to do duty at the mines.
A small quantity of the nyili and padi crops planted early in June was harvested and the remainder of the kribang crop planted in May was dug up for the consumption of the labour force.

Manager.

SIBU.
December, 1919.
Opium to the value of $200 was discovered by the Customs Officials, on the s. s. Gladys, prior to clearing for Singapore. It had been concealed in a cooking pot, with a false bottom, and in a box, the plank sides of which bad been hollowed out.
On the 16th the Honble. the Resident, 1st Division, wirelessed that the price of opium had been raised. Oya and Mukah were advised by telephone of the increase on the same day and all stocks of opium, at that time in the hands of the local agents, were checked.
Mr. W. H. Jacques left for Matu, on the 8th, in order to audit the accounts, but was unable to enter the river owing to there being a high sea on the bar. He proceeded to Rejang and after linishing the audit at this station went to Matu. Mr. Jacques returned to Sibu on the 20th having completed the audit. A report on the audit has been forwarded to the Honble. the Treasurer.
The sum of $4,000 was remitted from the Rejang to the Sibu Treasury.
On the 13th, the body of a male child, aged about six mouths was found, tied up in a sack, off
38
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, FEBRUARY 2, 1920.
the Government wharf. There is no doubt that the child met its end by foul play as on examination of the corpse it was found that two wounds had been inflicted on the chest and two on the back. A reward has been offered to any person who will give information which will lead to the arrest and conviction of any person or persons concerned in the murder, but with no result up to date.
A sad accident occurred just above Pulo Kerto, on the 23rd, in which two Malay women were drowned. It appears that five women were returning from Kerto in a cranky boat which upset, three of the women were saved in an exhausted condition and two were drowned. The bodies were recovered a few days later.
A Dayak, named Umar, was accidentally speared by a relation of his, named Langi, while hunting pig. Umar was treated in the local hospital and made a speedy recovery.
Mr. Gifford report a strange case which occurred at Kapit. A Dayak named Jingan, of Sanga's house, appears to have gone suddenly off his head and attacked a Chinaman, who was working in his garden near the Dayak house. Jingan inflicted a severe wound on the Chinamans leg and it is feared be may loose the use of his foot. The Dayak was seized by his friends and relations before he could do further mischief and is now being detained in jail under medical supervision.
On the 15th, I left for Kapit, accompanied by Mr. H. D Aplin, to attend a peace-making between the down-river Dayaks and the Dayak ex-rebels. The ceremony took place on the 18th and went off satisfactorily.
Later in the month a similar peace-making took place between the Kayans and the up-river Dayaks which went off without a hitch. I was unfortunately unable to attend this ceremony as I hail to return to Sibu on the 19th.
It is to be hoped that the Upper Rejang tribes will live together more harmoniously in the future than they have in the past.
There have been numerous applications for sites on which to erect shops as all vacant pieces of land in the bazaar have been taken up. It is proposed to erect a row of brick shops behind the present brick buildings which may satisfy present needs but in the near future it will be necessary to make, a new bazaar on the mainland.
The export trade is steadily increasing in consequence of the price of para rubber and jelutong having increased, but the cost of living has enormously increased, so much so that wages of coolies, working on rubber gardens, has doubled within the last few years.
The prospects of a good harvest of hill and wet padi are good. A number of the down-river people will lie harvesting sufficient for their own consumption by the end of January.
Communication with Kuching has considerably improved during the past month as the British Malaysian Manufacturing Companys motor launch has made two trips to and from Goebilt during the month.
The s. s. Sarawak also called on two occasions.
The s. s. Gladys arrived direct from Singapore on two occasions and made one clearance.
The s. s. Fleuo arrived from Singapore once only during the month, but cleared twice.
The value of imports and exports for 1919 have about trebled those of 1918. The value of exports is $300,000 over that of imports which is satisfactory when the large increase in the quantity and value of rice imported is taken into consideration.

December, 191.9.
General. Having found various irregularities in the cash and books at Dalat, I held a preliminary enquiry upon Wee Hong Kee's conduct. He was later on given notice to leave directly a new man should be found to take his place. A fuller report upon the matter has been submitted to the Honble. the Treasurer.
On the 7th the Resident of Mukah and Oya arrived and I accompanied him to Dalat on the 9th. We returned to Oya on the 12th. During our stay in Dalat Mr. Owen held Court whilst I was kept busy in going through the books and examining Wee Hong Kees affairs. Mr. Owen returned to Mukah on the 13th. He arrived again on the 21st, and having received a kind invitation from the Honble. the Resident 3rd Division to spend Christmas in Sibu, we left for that station on the 23rd and were, still away at the end of the month.
A telegram was received on the 17th informing me that the price of opium had been raised 50%.There was no trouble and very little comment upon the advance in price.
The Dalat gambling farm was sold nt the end of the month and resulted in a rise of 100%.
Court.There were no cases of much importance held during the month. Mr. Owen held a final nquiry into the Medong murder, but the five Dayaks who had been detained managed to prove an alibi and were therefore released unconditionally.
P. W. D., etc.The prisoners were employed on the usual work in Oya and Dalat. The boat-shed at Oya was entirely re-roofed, and the boats repaired. A new fence was made round part of the cattle ground.
Food Control.The supply of rice at Dalat was getting very low towards the end of the month. I shall be able to sell a little to the Dalat people from Oya.
Trade The price raw sago still remaining high, trade was very good. Money appears to be very plentiful amongst the Melanaus, but sooner or later it finds its way into the pockets of the Chinese.
Five sailing vessels and one steamship entered the port during the month and the same number cleared.
The principal exports were :
Raw sago	...	151 koyans
Jelutong	...	240 piculs
Imports for Dec. $ 17,526 Exports for Dec. $ 36,919
Total to date 387,574 Total to date 734,801

MUKAH.
?
December, 1919.
With the exception of the usual sago land disputes, Court work has been light during the month. A native was punished for attempting to swindle an old woman when paying her a considerable sum of money by informing her that in every case a large note was of more value than a small one, and including in his payment a number of Sarawak five dollar notes.
I was at Oya and Dalat from the 7th to the 13th of the month, holding Court at both places.
I again left for Oya on the 21st, and was still away at the end of the month.
During the month repairs were carried out on some of the Tilian bridges, a large number of the belian planks having been removed, in some cases even the beams were missing. The upper part of the road was also cleared.
The line to Oya was down on the 18th, but the break was found on the following day near Mukah. As the line had become deeply embedded in the sand, the resistance was still heavy, and it was naturally concluded that the break was some distance away.
On the 27th it was reported that a number of buffaloes had escaped from Tanjong Basong and had completely destroyed a large area of padi. The matter is being looked into.
The Milanoes have planted a great deal more padi than is usually the case, but in numbers of cases promising plantations have been ruined for want of weeding. In other cases swamp padi has been planted out on dry sandy soil.
Since the sale of rice has been taken over, distribution has continued smoothly, aud the supply here should be sufficient to last out the monsoon.
The sea has been high throughout the month and ten vessels have been waiting a considerable time to clear.
The principal exports, exclusive of Balingian, are as below :
1918.	1919.
Raw sago ...	60 koyans	132 koyans
Jelutong	... 260 piculs	320 piculs

BARAM.

December, 1919.
Jiew and his father Katnbar were imprisoned for three and two years respectively for theft. They had stolen over thirty piculs of jelutong from Kenyahs and Muriks at Long Temalla and over $150 in cash from a Chinese hawker at Tasong. Ah Jiew, Singkun and Tambi Kassim were imprisoned for six months and six strokes with rotan for petty theft.
Fines and fees amounted to $1,148.63.
I returned from visiting the headwaters on the 4th instant and paid the sum of $2,166.99 into Treasury.
I visited the Silat, Lio Matu and the Akar and collected all outstanding tax and fines and made a new list of names for tax.
No Kalabits came down to meet me. It is reported that there is a sickness amongst them which I presume is influenza.
Arrangements were made to visit the Kalabit country in May to collect the tax and I warned all the Kayans and Kenyahs to have theirs ready also.
P. C. Suleiman of Lio Matu was sentenced to six months imprisonment for a breach of regulations by trading and P.C. Akup was dismissed. Hassan and Majit, two Miris, are now left in charge and warned that they are not allowed to trade or hear any cases and must not leave the fort to go and settle disputes in Kalabit country.
Tama Aping Nipar. Murik chief, is to be in charge of the Kalabits and settle their disputes and to report these to Hassan and he must send a written report down-river.
The up-river people are all busy working damar and there must be nearly 1,000 piculs of this produce still in their houses and about the same amount in the bazaar at Long Akar.
Penghulu Abau Jau has over 100 piculs of his own. About ten chiefs and their followers numbering about 50 in all wish to pay a visit to Kuching after the landas with the Penghulu.
I arranged a site for the new bazaar at Long Akar and Long Lama and informed the Chinese that they must have the shops finished in three months and in future they must not spend more than three nights at each pangkalan.
The Kayans are harvesting their padi agit and all the people should have a record harvest. The padi is looking very well indeed in all the rivers visited.
Engkabang is reported in large quantities as far as Long Pata and they should be gathering this produce in another two months.
Tan Bak Noi was arrested on being suspected of causing the death to one Wee Kee of Bintulu in April 1912 and forwarded to that district.
Nyawai and Bujang escaped from prison in 21st instant early in the morning and were still at large at end of month.
It was reported that all the people in Tutau and Apoh were scared and would not go to their farms without being fully armed I wrote to the chiefs informing them that they and their followers would be heavily fined if any more reports were heard.
The estate of Brunei trailers and police of Lio Matu, imprisoned by H. H. the Tuan Muda, were settled, only that of P. C. Mumin being held over, as it is reported he owes a lot of money to the Kalabits and I am unable to obtain amounts until that district has been visited.
On the kind invitation of Honble. Resident 4th Division I left for Miri on the 22nd instant accompanied by Mr. Andreini to spend Christmas and New Year.
Orders having been received from Honble. Resident 4th Division the light-house and grounds were put in good order and handed over to Miri which station will be responsible for its up-keep and maintenance in future.
The prisoners were engaged during the month on ornamental grounds and clearing up. It is very hard to keep the grounds clear at present owing to having no scythe blades.
Owing to rice in store going bad, I sold fifty bags, as the harvest should begin in middle of January.
Many Chinese exported jungle produce to Miri to try and catch a boat at Miri for Kuching.
Rainfall was 8'89 inches.

The gross out-put of coal from the mines amounted to 3,037.5 tons; 707.5 tons were consumed by our boilers and the balance 2,330 tons was sent to wharf.
We shipped to Labuan 1,432 tons and 78 tons bunkers were supplied to H. H. S. Y. Zahora and local launches.
Coal in stock at the end of the mouth was 960 tons.
Everything went smoothly in both Mining and Engineering Departments. Owing to an increase of water in the mines, we are obliged to keep the three Lancashire boilers continually under steam. For several months previous to this we had been able to manage with two.
The No. 1 small lighter was beached for repair on the 25th and was still under repairs at the end of the month.
The coal sales at Labuan amounted to 1,549 tons and the following steamers took bunkers.

THE ART OF SELF-
EXPRESSION.
T
HIS remarkable little book ex-
plains exactly how YOU may
acquire in a very short time a facile
command of language, both in writing and in speaking. It tells how you may make certain of success in life by developing your latent powers of clear thought and of forceful convincing expression.
The self-conscious toungue-tied individual is seriously handicapped at every turn. Unable to impress favourably those with whom he comes into contact by his powers of expression, he is regardedoften unjustlyas a mere nonenity. On the other hand, the man who has learnt the all-important Art of Self-Expression moves on from success to success, aided immeasurably by his ability to marshall his thoughts quickly and with confidence, and to express them arrestingly and authoritatively. In business life he stands out among his fellows; his ability is recognised; promotion awaits him. Socially, he is admired and sought after as a witty conversationalist and a fascinating companion.
Whatever may be your station, or your profession in life, a knowledge of the Art of Self-Expression will help you enormously to achieve complete and lasting success. If you are ambitious to make your way in the world, write to-day for a copy (sent post-free) of The Art of Self-Expression to :
