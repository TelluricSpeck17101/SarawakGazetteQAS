CORRESPONDENCE
[ The Editor is not responsible for the opinions of"
correspondent.]
30th. August, 1920.
The Editor, Sarawak Gazette,
Kuching.
DEAR SIR,
The following may interest some of your readers. A small motor was sent to Singapore for repairs. The Firm to whom it was sent advised me that they did not undertake that class of work, but kindly volunteered to hand the machine to another Firm. It was accordingly handed over to a well-known Singapore Motor Firm. After a time I was informed that the repairs would cost as much as a new Motor its some damaged parts would have to be made. It was suggested that the machine should be dispatched to the American makers for repair. As I was aware that the repairs required were not extensive, I had the motor sent back to Sarawak, where it was perfectly repaired within a few days of arrival.
I have now received the bill for repairs, which
amounts to $2 only !
Yours faithfully,
PROFITEER.
WE publish below some correspondence which appeared in recent issues of the Straits Times on Poker. Perhaps some of our readers may be able to throw further light on the questions raised.
A Card Problem.
To the Editor of the Straits Times.
Sir,I am writing to ask if one of your numerous readers will be so kind as to do me the favour to settle a question of Poker rules.
A slight difference of opinion arose in a friendly game the other evening, the facts of which are as follows:
A opens a jack-pot, discards one card, and having drawn one card, wins the hand, the other players going out.
Being asked to show his 'openers" A puts down a small Straight" 5, 6, 7, 8, of various suits, and a Joker.
B says that A has lost the hand because he opened on nothing, as shewn by the fact that if any one card is pointed out by A as the one he drew, the other four do not show a pair of Jacks or better in other words A cannot show his openers".
A says he took the risk and having filed the hand contends that B is wrong. He cannot show the card discarded (He afterwards admits that it was a low card of no value.)
B's contention is that the Straight cannot represent A's openersand that though it may be a permissible bluff to open a "jack-pot without the necessary cards, the openers must appear to be in the first five cards dealt.
For instance, if A had drawn one card of same value as one of those already in his hand he could have put down "threes" as his openers; or had he drawn a Jack or higher card he could have declared "a pair of Jacks" or better; and no one would have been any the wiser
Who is rightA or B?
Could you also tell me what is the penalty for opening a Jack-pot without having the necessary cards.Yours etc.,
F. G. D

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, SEPTEMBER 16, 1920.	208
To the Editor of the Straits Times.
Sir, In reply to your Sarawak correspondent, the article on Poker in the Encyclopaedia Britannica lays it down that, in jack-pots. Each player puts up an equal stake and receives a hand. The pot must then he opened by a player holding a hand of the value of a pair of jacks or better.
Nothing is said about the penalty on a player who opens without holding legitimate openers." I have always plaved that anvone who does this loses the money he has put up, which remains in the pool. Generally it is done by mistake. I have never come across a case, where a man persisted in opening knowing that he had not got openers. The only thing to do with such a man would be to ask him to get out of the game. - Yours, etc.,
H.
Singapore, September 8th. 1920.
To the Editor of the Straits Times.
Sir,Holey's Games Modernised 1909 Edition P. 132 says:
Should no one 'go in' save the original opener of the pot, he takes the pool; but in this case he is bound to show, to preclude fraud, that his cards really did include a pair of jacks, or some higher combination.
During the war, however, I have seen, amongst the youngsters, some curious Poker rules, and perhaps poor old Hoyle is no class now! Yours, etc ,
ONCE A J'OKER PLAYER NOW POOR
Singapore. September 8, 1920.
To the Editor of the Straits Times.
sir, In Johannesburg, when I learnt my poker, A would have gone out of the window.
Bs contention is quite correct, if A had Jacks or better, four to a straight or a Hush, he can say: Im splitting my openers" putting the discarded opener beside him, so that in case he is unsuccessful in lilting he can show the openers which lie should do whether he fills or not.
The penalty is, that A should double the Jack Pot. If B had been betting against A. B would have won providing he (B) had openers. In that case A would still have to make the amount of the Jack Pot good as it has not yet been opened.Yours, etc.,

Ground-glass Poisoning.
There is a widespread belief that the swallowing of ground glass is likely to be fatal in its results. Doubtless there is the liability to u particle of the glass perforating the bowel and leading to death from peritonitis ; but over and above this there are many who have the impression that the swallowing glass particles may prove fatal in some way apart from the occurrence of any perforation or peritonitis. Some deliberate experiments carried out by Simons mid von Glahn seem to prove that this notion is a myth. They deliberately fed animals with measured quantities of broken Petri dishes and test tubes; the size of the glass particles thus administer-
ed being graded by means of sieves, and varying from "large broken to fine powdered. None of the animals suffered in any way from having quantities of broken or powdered glass thus administered by the month, and the authors were unable to demonstrate any microscopic lesions in any part of their alimentary canal or viscera. (Medical Annual.)
UPPER SARAWAK.
BAU AND PAKU .

August.
Owing to the fact that all natives, and a large proportion of Chinese in the district have been clearing for padi during the month, Court work has been exceptionally light.
A Chinese of Tanjong Pauh reported having been waylaid and robbed of a sum of money. He asserted that he recognised one of his assailants, and the man was arrested and detained on a warrant. On the case being gone into it proved to be a trumped up charge, and the man who applied for the warrant was ordered to pay compensation.
A few cases of theft were dealt with Two Chinese were fined for obtaining a rubber garden permit by means of false statements. A Javanese coolie was sentenced for throwing away a quantity of strip rubber, which he should have carried to the godown.
Two Chinese absconded from a Japanese estate with a sum of money. I think these men will be arrested shortly.
The annual Chinese theatre was at Siniawan for a few nights, and large number of gardeners visited the bazaar. There was no disturbance.
The Bau pork farm was rented out at $71.50 per mensem, a decrease of $23.50 as compared with last year.
The price of turtle eggs was fixed for the whole district, allowance being made fur freight and wastage.
On checking Government supplies of padi. etc,, a considerable shortage came to light. This has been made good by the person responsible.
A Chinese who escaped from Bau jail during April was identified in Kuching jail by police sent from here.
The Chinese section of the Government School was inspected and favourably reported on as regards the senior classes.
Through the kindness of the Resident of 3rd. Division I was able to procure a shipment of plauks for the new barracks from Sibu. and the second block of buildings is now nearing completion. A new length of piping has been put down and water for bathing and drinking purposes laid on.
The telephone rentis from Buan to Siniawan was cleared by Dayak labour during the mouth.
On the 26th. a number of Dayaks burned off their clearings. Judging from the heat and smoke at Bau, the burns should have been successful. A few of the Krokoug Dayaks burned in July and have not yet planted. The result is that the clearings are already growing up again
Prison gangs have done a good deal of work on roads during the month, though much hindered by rain for some days.
On the 28lh. the Chinese celebrated sembayang hantu. The bazaar was crowded in the evening hut there were no disturbances reported.

Mr. Cutfield arrived bv s. I. Young Harry on the 17th.
There was a tuba fishing in the Simunjan river on the following day, which from the European s point of view was not a great success; but I am told that the natives did quite well, and were more or less satisfied with the results of the day.
Mr Culfield returned to Kuching on the 20th.
Eight hundred bags of padi are in readiness to ship to Kuching.
On the 28th. I received a letter from the Controleur of Sanggau in H. M. N. Indies saying that the arrest had been effected of Osen, Mai (f), Omar and Baki. These were wanted here for the murder of one Ong Cheng near Simunjan in June 1919. and concerning ufipin 1 visited Baki Karangan last January. I sent a guard off at once to takeover these people from the Dutch authorities, and they will be handed over at Balai Karangan.
I have to thank the Controleur of Sanggau for his courtesy and energy in this matter.
Two prisoners were severely punished for stealing rice while working in the padi godown, and for defamation of character, wherein they accused the policeman in charge of them of having stolen rice, and dividing it with them There were however five persons working in the godown at the time, and the evidence clearly proved that the P. C. had not been near the rice, but that while he went outside for a few minutes, these two prisoners went into the rice bin ; and further that they were sakit hati with him

The gross out-put of coal produced by the mines during the month was 2,019.08 tons, 465 tons of which was consumed by our boilers, and 1,554.08 tons delivered to the wharf.
The shipments for the month were as follows; -
The quantity of coal in stock at the end of the mouth was 312.16 tons.
I was away recruiting labour in Singapore at the beginning of the month, and returned here during the first week with twenty-one singkehs. This was all the singkeh labour available in Singapore at that time, and arrangements were made by telegraph with a labour agency at Hong-kong for another batch. The mandar who had been left to take charge of these on arrival at Singapore, arrived on Thursday the 12th. with seventy men.
A fatal accident occurred in the east panel return level of No. 9 mine, in which Liaw Heng, one of the old Chinese miners was killed instantaneously by a fail of roof, (shale) while another Chinese repairer, who was employed nearby received slight injuries.
The hill clearing burned off rather well during the third and fourth weeks, and about live acres of this was planted up with hill padi.
The swamp padi nursery was also made, in preparation for a limited acreage available for farming on the low-lying land contiguous to the Collieries.
The site for the engineer's new bungalow was selected on the hill-side to the east of No. 9 mine, and the necessary clearing and levelling of the ground is in progress.
Water supplies were sufficient, but if the present drought continues much longer, it will be necessary to regulate the flow for consumption.
The rainfall for the month was 7'02 inches.

Accompanied by Datu Awang Udin I left on a visit to the up-river Dayaks on 11th. But few cases of any importance were brought before me. Most of the people have sufficient rice to last through the current season.

decisions of die Court here were upheld. Mr and Mrs. Owen left for Oya on foot the night of the 30th.
On my return from up-river Mr. Horton reported that two prisoners named Yahyia and Jabal had escaped whilst working with the gang. The former man had escaped on a previous occasion and had been arrested m Kuching.
It was reported to me also that there had been insubordination amongst a certain number of the prisoners. They were duly punished.
A most unsual case of gross cruelty and callousness was brought up before the Court in which a Dayak named Indit had taken no trouble whatsoever to assist his son-in-law Galang. The latter was in a dying condition suffering from beri-beri. Indit was called to look after him, but delayed, affirming that he was busy feasting. On finding the corpse he declined to bury it, as it was in a too decomposed state.
Jabal was sentenced to one year R. I. for swindle. He escaped from custody and is still at large.
on 28th. a prisoner. Jali climbed up a betel-nut palm and fell down some 25 feet receiving some painful injuries. He is now being treated by the dresser.
On 28th the Court Writter from Balingean sent over one Ui Ah Soon and wife. The latter appears to be quite insane. Her conditon had evidently preyed on her husbands mind.
New quarters were put up by the prisoners and local carpenters for the use of the light-house keeper.
Three Pontianak Malays arrived from Balingean reporting they had been wrecked off Tatau. All their property was lost. They were sent to Kuching.
