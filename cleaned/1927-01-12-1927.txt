NOTES.
(November.)
As our next issue does not appear until after. Yule-tide, we take this opportunity of wishing everyone of our readers a very happy
Christmas.	His Highness the Rajah accompanied by Messrs. H. B. Crocker, A. A. Rennie, C. P. Lowe and F. G. Day, visited St. Thomas' School on the 17th.
WE congratulate the Dayang Leonora on her birthday which was celebrated by a dance at Astana on the 18th.
THE boys of the Malay Lay Schools were entertained by His Highness the Rajah at Astana on the 21st when the annual prize-giving took place. The Dayang Leonora presented the prizes. Three addresses were read to His Highness, after which the boys of each school sang a song, and it may be remarked that the power of the boys' voices testify to their health of body. After this ceremony, the boys adjourned for supper and a cinematograph entertainment.
MR. and Mrs. O. Lang arrived on the 31st October. Mrs. Lang has recently returned from Europe.
MR. H. Jacques returned from furlough on the 31st October, and then proceeded to Limbang on duty on the 10th.
MR R. D. Binnie returned from furlough on the 17th.
MR. A. M. Forrest, Agent for the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, left for England on the 12th on leave, having been relieved by Mr. J. A. McCullagh who arrived on the 31st October.
THE p.s. Adeh was towed down the San- tnbong River and sunk on a mud bank during the month. Thus passed away an iron vessel which did valuable service on the coast for over forty years.
Ms. F. W. de V. Skrine, Mr. and Mrs. R. W Chater and Mr. T. Corson left for England on the 12th on furlough.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, DECEMBER 1, 1927.
WE extend a welcome to Miss B. Slater, who has come to take up an appointment as Assistant Matron, and to Mr. W. S. B. Buck who has been appointed a Cadet and has been detailed to do duty at Sibu. Both arrived by this s.s. Kuching on the 17th. Dr. J, G. Reed, who was here on a short visit, was also a passenger by the same vessel.
THE public were notified on the 10th of the opening of the new Kanowit Wireless Station for traffic. This marks the opening of the twentieth wireless station in Sarawak. We 1 understand that the Rejang station will shortly be completed.
MR. H. C. P- Adams left on the 12th on leave.
MR. F. F. Boult, who was accompanied by
Mrs. Boult, arrived back from leave on the l5th and has been appointed Resident of the First Division as from that date. Mr. and Mrs. Boult intend to occupy the house formerly used as the Sarawak Club.
ARMISTICE Day, 11th, was proclaimed a public holiday, and the two minutes' silence at 11 a.m. was observed.
THE Illustrated London News of October 15th, contains a very interesting article entitled "Sarawak seen from the sky" and is illustrated by a series of excellent aerial photographs taken by the Air Survey Company, Ltd. A full page photograph depicting a river and its tributaries resembles the branch of a tree.
WE regret to hear that Mr. J. S. W. Bean met with a serious motor accident on the 27th instant when his car came into collision with a Fiat car in Rock Road. We extend our sincere sympathy and hope that he will have a speedy recovery.
WE deeply deplore the death of the Astana cat which recently expired suddenly on the lawn, after a period of at least twenty five years' residence in that quarter.
Armistice Day.
This year was marked by the sale of Flanders Poppies in Kuching for Earl Haig's fund.
The arrangements for this were made rather at the eleventh hour, and only a small number of poppies was received from Singapore. In the circumstances, therefore, it was decided that only the European community should be approached in this instance.
The sale of poppies in Government Offices and European commercial firms on the morning of the 10th was undertaken by the Dayang Leonora and Mrs. Pitt-
Hardacre, who proved an irresistible team, the amount collected being over $300.
At the Ex-Service Dinuer the following evening, all defaulters who were found to have come on parade improperly dressed without a Flanders Poppy, were given the option of signing a chit or forfeiting their rations. This ruse de guerre resulted in the addition of a further $125 to the fund.
The Ex-Service Dinner was held this year in the Forest Bungalow. Tables were laid for forty, but unfortunately there were one or two members absent through sickness. A new feature this year was the entertainment of native ex-service inert, members of the Sarawak Rangers and the Sarawak Police, who were accommodated in a pavilion adjacent to the dining room. Towards the conclusion of the meal, the native ex-service men filed into the room, and joined in drinking the loyal toasts. These were:-"The Rajah"; "The King"; and "The Glo- rious Dead". The last named, after being proposed in Malay and in English, was drunk in silence, after which the buglers of the Sarawak Rangers sounded the Last Post.
Thereafter the company spent a pleasant half-
hour over coffee and liqueurs. After the Orderly Officer's inspection, during which complaints were dealt with in a summary manner, our Blue Marine (lately returned from fresh conquests in the fields of peace) entertained the party with a war-time anecdote, and several members contributed vocal items.
Towards 9.30 p.m., the company adjourned, and were conveyed by a detachment of the M.T.A.S.C.
(Irregulars) to the Sarawak Club, where dancing
was enjoyed to a late hour.
Indian Snakes, Snake-Bites, and Snake-Charmers.
In the statistics published by the Government of India, of 'Deaths from Snake-bite,' it is appalling to read of the tens of thousands of people killed by snakes every year. I think these figures are generally questioned, and it is more than half-suspected that a large proportion of the returns under 'Death from Snake-bite' are really cases, not of snake poison, but of poison administered by man. In a period of over forty years I have known of only seven cases of death from snakebite.
It is strange how ignorant natives are as to snakes; nearly every snake, in their eyes, is poisonous, excepting some three or four very common ones, which they admit are not poisonous. Though these cannot injure one by their bite, they can in other ways. For instance, the dhaman, though not poisonous, turns a somersault and hits you with its tail! while there is another snake (which I have not come across) which spits in your eye-causing blindness! But after all, the European in India is no less inclined to regard every snake as poisonous.
I am not aware of any certain cure for snake-bite. If one can cut the bite open at once, and encourage it to bleed, by pressure, and then apply permanganate of potash, there is every hope of recovery. I saved the lives of two men by this treatment. One of them was a syce (groom) of mine. He and my head syce were leading two of my ponies home, after dark. Instead of keeping to the road, they took a short-
cut by a foot-path. The junior syce, who was in front, stepped into a hole, and then on to a thorn, as he thought. He got home, and while rubbing his pony down, felt a strange sleepy feeling coming over him; this he mentioned to the head syce, who was a very intelligent man. The idea at once struck him that the supposed thorn must have been the fang of a snake, so without any delay he at once produced the man before me. The man had been bitten on the sole of his heel. After I had tied a tight ligature, just above the ankle, I washed his foot, and discovered the two punctures. On trying to cut these open I learnt for the first time what the sole of a native's foot is like; the skin had hardened into a horny substance, which even an old razor could not cut. I had therefore to burn the place, using a red-
hot ramrod. I must have penetrated quarter of an inch, but the man felt nothing. It was doubtless due to the position of the bite that the poison did not circulate so rapidly as it generally does. I then gave the man a dose of strong spirits of ammonia, and made two of the servants walk him about for half-an-hour. As he was no worse I sent him to his quarters. Though this syce recovered, the poison rendered him permanently listless.
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, DECEMBER 1, 1927.

The other case was that of a Moplah. I had several gangs of Moplahs. They are very good workmen, and if properly handled are well behaved. But they are an excitable people, and will use the knife they carry in their waist-belts if their blood is aroused. I therefore had separate lines for the Moplahs. Their rooms were each about twelve feet by twelve feet, and each room accommodated four men. One night at about eight o'clock there was a good deal of talking in the back veranda, and my boy came in to say that two Moplahs had come to report that one of their number had been bitten by a cobra. Only a week before a Moplah had been bitten by a cobra (the same cobra as events proved); the matter was not reported to me till too late, and I reached his lines only to find him a dead man. On this occasion they had lost no time, and I started at once to see the man. I was pleased to find they had tied a ligature above the bite, which was on the shin, half-way between the knee and the ankle. I at once cut the two punctures open- made a cross cut; then I encouraged the bleeding by pinching the flesh round the bite, and applied Condy's fluid, afterwards administering a dose of strong spirits of ammonia.
I then sent for my dear old Maistry-a Beda and not a Moplah. He had already got news of the event, and came prepared with his remedies. His method of procedure is worth recording in detail. His remedies consisted of all manner of hot things, chillies and ginger being the main ingredients. These were ground into a paste, and then all mixed together. I fancied this was to be applied to the bite; but no! Old Thimma Maistry made the man open his mouth. Seizing his tongue, as though it were that of a bullock, he dragged it forward, and then rubbed this hot paste well into the man's
tongue. This stuff was so hot that it made the man's eyes water freely. He was unable to stand it for long, so he shook Thimma's hands free, declaring it was enough. Thimma, however, insisted on giving him a second dose. He started to knead up the paste, and when it had reached the consistency he required, he went up to the man, drew down his eye-lids, and just plastered both eyes with the cruel mixture. It certainly had the effect of arousing the man, and caused him to shake off the sleepiness which was coming over him. After a pause of a minute or so, Thimma held up a lighted candle, and asked the man how many candies he saw. On getting the reply 'One' he pronounced that as a good sign. When the man had to some extent got over the shock of this terrible application to his eyes, Thimma decided that it was time for a second application. The man protested with all the vehemence he was capable of, but Thimma was obdurate, and again both eyes were plastered over. Repeating his
previous performance, he again held up a candle and asked, 'How many candles do you see?' How the poor wretch could see anything was a puzzle to me. However, he replied 'One.' Thimma then turned to me and said the man would certainly recover. Had he seen two or more candles the case would have proved fatal.
The man recovered and was back to work in three days. I am sure Thimma's drastic treatment helped. Whether by itselt it would have saved the man's life I know not. It certainly had the effect of arousing the man and putting a stop to fatal drowsiness, which is generally the beginning of the end.
The next morning, on going up to see the man, I elicited particulars. The man was entering his quarters, and a cobra was also entering at the same time. This, however, he was not aware of till he stepped on the cobra, who very naturally resented being trod upon. I then learnt that the oobra shared the quarters with the men. For a long time they were fully aware of it, and permitted the cobra to go out and come in, without interfering in any way. These Moplahs really half worshipped this cobra. When I heard that the cobra lived in a hole in the corner of the room, I sent for my Maistry with orders to bring a couple of coolies and a crow-bar. When they arrived the Moplahs begged me not to kill the cobra! This after two out of the four of that room had been bitten-one actually succumbing to its bite.
I am very punctilious in respecting the superstitions and practices of the strange peoples of India, but it would have been criminal to leave that cobra where he had taken up his abode. So we dug him out and killed him. A magnificent specimen.
II.
The local natives all think that the dbaman or 'rat snake,' is the female of the cobra. This is not so, but
I have shot a cobra copulating with a dhaman. Whether it is possible for them to interbreed, and produce progeny, I do not know; but I fancy not, as I have never seen any intermediates. One very often sees the cobra and the dhaman in close proximity-wherever the dhaman goes, the cobra follows. Apart from their difference in appearance-colour, scales, absence of hood in the dhaman, &c.-the dhaman is harmless, while the cobra is poisonous.
Many years ago, one of my cattlemen was aroused at night by a bite in the back. He aroused the man sleeping beside him, and told him that he had been bitten by a snake. This other man, thinking it was a rat, told him so, and turning over, went to sleep. When he awoke in the morning, to his surprise, he found his companion a corpse. I went over, as usual, the next morning, and was horrified to find the man dead, and to hear the cause.
I at once sent for a man who had the reputation of being able to charm any snake, and to capture it, The man arrived. All he had was a 'gunny bag,' which contained his musical instrument, a pair of forceps, and a flat shallow basket. I had often heard of these snake- charmers' ability to charm snakes, and to bring them to the musical instrument (a sort of pipe, made out of a gourd), but I had never seen the act performed. It is the general opinion with Europeans that the whole thing is a fraud; that the man first releases a tame harmless snake, one that has had its fangs drawn, and that this tame snake is captured, and pronounced to be the one sought after. I therefore was most careful to watch the man narrowly. I discerned him coming from a distance, and I kept an eye on him till he stood in front of me. I made him empty out the contents of his bag, and there was nothing more in it than what I have mentioned.
The snake-charmer told us to be perfectly silent, and to keep out of sight; so I and my Maistry stood outside, a short distance from the door of the shed, at a point where we could watch all the movements of the snake- charmer. He went just within the door, and arranging his forceps and basket so that they could be readily seized, sat down or his haunches and started to play his instrument, at the same time swaying his body from side to side, and slowly moving his instrument round and round in a small circle.
He certainly had not been playing more than a minute or two, when I caught sight of the cobra, moving slowly, just under the thatch of the roof. It then passed out of view, and I saw nothing of it for some little time. Still, I knew it was approaching from the way the man accelerated the music, and went through movements that might well prove hypnotising.
Then I caught sight of the cobra gliding down the wall, and on to the floor. Here it paused for a while, raising its head, with hood expanded, carefully taking stock. Soon it begin to move, infinitely slowly, towards the man-stopping from time to time, evidently suspicious. When it had come to within five or six feet of the man it stopped ; coiling itself up. it kept about eighteen inches of its lenth erect, with hood expanded. It appeared fascinated. Its head moved from side to side, as though keeping time to the music. The suspense on my part became almost painful.
The snake had evidently no intention of coming any nearer. This the man seemed to realise, for he began to move towards the snake. He never ceased his monotonous music, while the circular motion of his instrument was accelerated, and at the same time the swaying of his body was quickened. As the man got nearer and nearer, the cobra showed no sign of resentment; on the contrary, to judge from its move- ments, it seemed to be enjoying the music. Once or twice it put its head back, and I feared it was going to strike.
When within reach, the man, as quick as thought, shot his hand forward, and unerringly had the cobra by the throat. He immediately stood bolt upright, thus holding the snake nearly clear of the ground. He had seized the snake so cleverly that its mouth was forced open. With marvellous celerity he whipped out both fangs. The cobra was thus harmless. Squatting down, he now inserted the head of the cobra under the lid of
306
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, DECEMBER'1, 1927
the basket, and by & gentle push now and then (keeping the lid of the basket all the time resting on the cobra's back) he induced it to disappear into the basket.
At the end of the performance the man was distinctly exhausted. He called for water to drink. I am positive the man caught the cobra which had caused the death of my cattleman. Often before this had I and others seen this cobra on the roof. No cobra was seen till many months afterwards, and this I was fortunate enough to kill; it was much smaller than the first. There probably are cases where these snake-charmers come round with a tame snake, but this was not one of them.
III.
The python is a very handsome snake of great size, often twelve feet and more in length. It is enormously powerful, and could crush any ordinary sized animal, but this is not its mode of attack. I have never seen it capture its prey, but I have frequently cut out hares and young deer from a dead python. In no instance was a single bone broken. In every case the animal had been swallowed whole, and tail first. A python lays an immense number of eggs, a hundred and more, and, strange to say, hatches them by keeping the eggs in the folds of its coiled up body. It can exist without food for two months during incubation; and the young ones, when hatched out, do not seem to want food for a month or so. The python is thus peculiar in incubating its eggs. Most snakes bury their eggs, and the warmth of the earth hatches them out.
I once had an experience of the incredible strength of a python, I had been stalking big game in the early morning. When the sun had just about risen we (the shikari and myself) were following a jungle track. I noticed what I took to be a tiny stream of water, some twenty yards in front of me, running across the track. When we approached a little closer, to my surprise, the shikari, taking off his head cloth, ran forward and seized the 'stream,' which then only I discovered to be a python! What induced the man thus to lay hold of the python I do not know. Anyway, his act proved infectious, for, laying down my rifle, I went to his assistance; putting my arms round his waist. I pulled with all my strength. The two of us were not in it in this tug-of-war. The python never hurried, nor did it show the least sign of being aware that it had been gripped. It just pulled the two of us forward, as though there were no restraining force. When the shikari's hand came in contact with the bush, into which the python was entering, he let go. We might just as well have tried to hold back a locomotive! A python is usually harmless, but had we been able to drag it out, it might in its stuggle to get free have wound itself round some part of our anatomy, when we certainly should have had a bad time!
1 think all snakes are most graceful, beautiful creatures. The cobra is no exception-indeed, when it expands its hood, there is something regal in its appearance. As it never strikes without first expanding its hood, there is no mistaking it; so it is generally known as a cobra, and a poisonous snake. Not so the other poisonous snakes.
The cobra feeds largely on rats and frogs; and the process of swallowing its prey is most protracted. It is a common thing to hear the piteous cry of a frog that a cobra has circumvented and seized from behind. If one cautiously approach, guided by the agonising cry of the frog, which cry it issues at short intervals, one will find only half of the frog visible, the other half being in the cobra's mouth. The cobra's mouth is not large enough to take its prey at a mouthful, so the poor creature has to be w ell slimed over before it can slip down, inch by inch.
Several times my appearance on the scene has caused the cobra to release the frog. Strange to say, the victim generally hops away at a great pace, apparently none the worse. So it looks as if the cobra does not inject poison into its prey. Indeed, it seems impossible for it to do so, seeing that it has to creep up slowly and silently without showing itself; therefore it cannot raise its head to strike-
it can only grab its prey. This action does not permit its fangs to rise from the horizontal position (namely, parallel with its jaw) to the erect position, and so no poison can be injected.
Many a time I have been made aware of the presence of a cobra in the house by the way a frog has scampered
I across the room. When thus terrified a frog does not I hop-he seems to run; at no other time does a frog travel in this fashion.
Russell's viper is easily recognised from the thickness of his tail; one has to look twice to ascertain which end is head and which tail. It is most disinclined to move, even when quite exposed. It lies so motionless that one is apt to take it for a dead snake. The chain of chocolate markings down the middle of the back clearly distinguishes it as a Russell's viper. Due to these markings it is also called the 'chain viper.'
Vipers have slender necks, from which the head widens out considerably, then tapers towards the snout -
somewhat pear-shaped. Excepting in the 'pit' vipers, the head of all vipers is covered with small scales, not shields (very large scales). The 'pit' vipers have shields on the head, and are recognisable by a distinct 'pit' or depression between the eye and the nasal shield.
The scales which border the lip of a snake are called 'labials'; those along the upper lip are 'supralabials'; those along the lower lip are 'infralabials.'
The cobra, the hamadryad, and coral snakes have the third supralabial larger than the others, and this touches the eve and the nasal shield. All these snakes have shields, and not scales (like the viper), on the top of their head.
In kraits the middle row scales on the back are larger than the scales on either side of it; and the fourth inftalabial is larger than the others. As with all poisonous snakes, there are larger transverse plates (not scales) extending right across the belly.
The quickest way to decide whether a snake is harmless or poisonous is to turn it over on its back. If the scales on the belly are small, like those of a fish, or if there are short transverse plates, with three or four rows of scales on either side, the snake is harmless. If the snake has large transverse plates running right across the whole width of the belly, it is very probably poisonous.
The cobra, the hamadryad, coral snakes, vipers, and kraits are the poisonous snakes of India. I have indicated their distinguishing features. All sea snakes are poisonous.

Harrison Smith Fund.
This Fund, with which the name of Harrison Smith has been prominently associated, provides for the execution of medical work in the Baram head-waters. The work itself, which was made possible as a result of the munificence of Professor Harrison W.Smith, is to be continued by the Government of Sarawak.
As a mark of the high appreciation with which the Government of Sarawak regards both the Professor's generosity 'and the sympathetic interest which he has always taken in the welfare of the natives of Sarawak, the good work will be carried on through the medium of the Fund Institution which will permanently bear his name.

KUCHING.
October, 1927.
Mr. C. S. Griffiths, Chief Land Officer, reports: - Drainage Scheme at Sungei Moyan, Samarahan.-15-foot drain from Telok Sabang.-A further length of 4158 feet was accepted during the month, making the total distance taken over to the end of the month 7458 feet.
7-foot drain from Sungei Moyan to Sungei Nonok. -No more of this drain was actually taken over but the work was almost completed by the end of the month and will be measured up early in November.
Clearing of the Sungei Moyan. -This work is progressing under a new contractor between the 7-foot ditch and point where the 15-foot ditch will cut the river and is now nearly complete. The clearing of the lower reaches of this stream is contemplated, but this is a comparative simple matter.
Lundu Road. -About 1 1/2 miles of new construction was done, which takes the road as far as S. Kandong. This stream is about 10 1/2 miles from the junction with the Matang Road and therefore nearly 20 miles from Kuching, Plans and cross sections of the main streams have been made and handed to the Commissioner of Public Works in order that the bridges may be put in hand.
I inspected the whole of this road on 28th and 29th. The work appears to have been well done and if the bridges were it), a small car would have but little difficulty in traversing the entire distance. Temporary bridges and culverts are about to be established.
Kuching. -Considerable progress was made during the month in the matter of the purchase of land in the Sekama district and the laying out of lots for the settlement of the Padungan Malays who have been obliged to move in connection with the Town Planning Scheme Negotiations in this connection have been protracted, but it is hoped that this affair will have been completed by the end of next month.
The necessary forms etc. for an entirely new routine in connection with the handling of applications for land were received from the Printing Office during the month and the new scheme will be put into operation early in November. It is hoped that this will enable closer touch to be maintained with this branch of the work.
165 applications for land were received during the month and 127 inspections were carried out.

September. 1927.
SlMANGGANG.
General.-A regatta was held on the4th and 5th instants, all Peughulus from up and down river arrived also Penghulus Isek and Mun of Saribas and Nyalu and Engkamat of Kalaka. Mr. Bruce from Sadong, Messrs. Allman and Hirst, Datu Hakim and Inche Mohd. Zin from Kuching.
Messrs. Allman and Hirst arrived here in connection with pepper improvement at Engkilili and are try- ing a new chemical supplied by the Department of Agriculture for spraying the vines.
The crop has been very heavy this year and much will be lost owing to insufficient coolies to harvest same. This is usually done by Dyak women who are now busy planting padi.
There are many new Chinese at Engkilili, mostly Kehs and relations of present pepper garden owners, these people are requiring land which is practically all held by Dyaks.
The most suitable land is across river from Court House towards the Lemanak, and there is no doubt that all the Dyaks who occupy this would move if old or 15 years old jungle could be supplied to them ; having no land like that in this Division the most suitable places would be Baram or Trusan where there is a considerable amount of old jungle, and, given a liberal area, these Dyaks would only be too keen as they are beginning to realise that sooner or later the land will be occupied by Chinese.
Agriculture- The padi planting has been delayed considerably owing to incessant rain.

General. -While I was at Saratok, Abang Abu Bakar, Junior Native Officer, Kabong, son of the late Abang Amek, was married to Haji Debedah, youngest daughter of Haji Ahir of Saratok.
The marriage was a very large affair and over 100 people accompanied Abang Abu Bakar and Abang Bujang from Kabong alone. I returned to Kabong on the 17th.
Agriculture.-All the engkabang trees in the Krian, Awek, Sebetan and Seblak are flowering heavily and it is generally believed that there will be a crop this year.
The Dyaks felled and tebassed their farms but most were unable to burn off owing to heavy and continuous rain.

General.-Some Chinese of the HongLee Syndicate, arrived at Lingga to investigate the Coal at Selantik, the Native Officer was ordered to give them help if required and tuai rumah Tagok was sent with them, he knowing the whereabouts of the outcrops in this locality, having accompanied Europeans before on the same quest.
Dysentery has been very bad in all the rivers and it would be a good thing if a travelling Dresser could be sent from Kuching, say for at least a month, to visit all houses administering any treatment required.

About the 6th or 7th, three Saratok bandongs laden with merchandise cleared together from this port for Kuching. They were caught in a gale near Puloh Burong and blown up the coast. One of these managed to put into Daro but the other two were less fortunate.
One belonging to Gan Tee of Saratok was wrecked five days later off Bintulu on the Kidurong side. The bandong and all its cargo were completely destroyed but no lives were lost. The third bandong with a Chinese nakoda and crew has not been heard of since.

SIBU.
September, 1927.
General.-I left for Kanowit on the 4th September accompanied by the Divisional Treasurer and reached Kapit the following day. On the 8th I left for N. Gat reaching there on the 10th. The new Government Station there is in course of construction, the site being a good one on high ground on the angle between the Gat and Balleh Rivers. I returned to Sibu on the 12th instant.
His Highness The Rajah's birthday was observed as a Public Holiday. An inspection of Police was held at 9 a.m. after the firing of a salute of 21 guns from the battery at 8 a.m. A feu de joie was fired by the Police after the inspection. The Parade was very creditable.
P. W.D.-The jail was completed and further progress made with the building at Gat. The quarters in the Song Fort were roofed and repaired.
The Acting District Officer of Sibu, reports: -
General. -On the 17th a deputation of Sarikei Chinese saw the District Officer re boundary with Cantonese. They were told that after a given time anyone owning a pepper garden over the boundary would be forced to leave.
October, 1927.
General. -The Kong Wai Sui were informed that their present building in the bazaar had been condemned and if rebuilt must be constructed of brick. Failing this another site must be found outside the bazaar area. This has since been done.
A site was decided on for the erection of a Cinema Theater. This will entail the removal of the Chinese School, a most dilapidated building. Assistance will be given the Chinese to erect a new and substantial school, but I see no signs of any attempt on the part of the traders or gardeners to assist themselves. I understand that numerous meetings have been held but that no funds have been collected. On making inquiries I find that the available funds are nil. The Chinese admit that the school is entirely supported by Government, with the exception of the very small fees, paid by parents of some of the children and there are over 100 children on the books.
From all reports it appears that the continuous rain experienced towards the end of October has destroyed any prospect of a heavy engkabang crop. The Kanowit and Entabai Dyaks report the crop as ruined, but there is a chance that the Mujong and Balleh and other streams such as Assan and Sarikei may partly retrieve the situation.
The District Officer, Mr. J. C. Swayne, Lower Rejang, reports: -
Two wireless masts were put in position with the help of kampong labour and the station is now complete, except for the engine.
Trade, etc.- Customs duties amounted to $897.84.
The heavy rains destroyed any prospect of an eng- kabang crop in the Balleh and I believe there is only a very small crop in the Batang Rejang.
