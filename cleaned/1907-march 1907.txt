YEARLY
REPORTS.
Simanggang.
January, 14th 1907.
RAJAB,I have the. honour to forward to Your Highness this my Yearly Report for the 2nd Division for 190G.
TRADE.
The Trade Returns for the three Rivers (the Ba- taug Lupar, Saribas, and Kalaka), for the year 1906 shew increases in both Imports and Exports for the Bataug Lupar and Saribas, and dec reuses in both items for the Kalaka river compared with 1905.
1906, TRADE RETURNS.
Imports. Exports.
B. Lupar	$138,662	$161,057
Saribas	104,050	84,977
Kalaka	105,028	127,764
Totals	$347,740	$373,798
1905, TBAI E RETURNS.
Imports. Exports.
B. Lupar	$124,539	$151,928
Saribas	84,230	67,124
Kalaka	116,158	151,122
Totals	$324,927	$370,174
Thus the Totals of Imports and Exports for 2nd
Division for 1906 are greater than those of 1905.
I attribute the failing off in the Trade in the Ka-
laka River to the sinall-pox, which kept on breaking
out in the Saratok Bazaar, and to the disturbances
caused by the breaking up of the Secret Society iu
the Ibus.

There has been a good increase in the export of
Rice and Paddy for 1906 over 1905. The decrease
in the export of gutta Jelutong is only to be expected

H-hite and black Pepper for 1905 and 1906.

Saribas 7	,.	3 272
Kalaka 802 387	26,252
. Total $52,944
I foretold a great increase in the export of pepper,
from the B. Lupar and the Kalaka especially, and
this turned out to be true as regards the B. Lupar
and but for the small-pox and troubles caused by the
Secret Society would have been true also of the Ka-
Jaka. I am unable to account for the falling off in
the Saribas. but there are few persons engaged in
pepper planting there.
At the close of the year 1906 in the Simanggang
Bazaar both rice and paddy were being sold for
more than they fetched in 1905. Rice sold for $1
for 2 gantangs. and Paddy for $1 a pas u.
Very little Native-grown rice was to be obtained
and it was being imported not too freely from Ku-
ching. The Garrison at L. Antu (as in 1905) had"
to be supplied from Simanggang.
.1 may say, dealing with the general trade of this
Division, that it has not recovered so much as I
hoped it would (during 1906) and the reasons for
this are, the small-pox (which lasted on until August)
throughout the country, the continued troubles and
threatened raids by the Ulu Ai rebels, and the Secret
Society in the Kalaka.
FINANCIAL STATEMENT.
The Net Revenue and Net Expenditure for the
year 1906, for the 2nd Division, shew a decrease in
the Revenue and an increase in the Expenditure.
Compared with 1905 the Net Revenue shews a
decrease of $884.77, and the Net Expenditure an
increase of $655.89.
In 1905 the Net Expenditure exceeded the
Revenue by $1,932.19., m 1906 it exceeds the
Revenue by $3,472.85.
The reasons for this falling off in the Revenue and
increase in the Expenditure are precisely the same
as were given in the Yearly Report for 1905, which
I need not repeat here.
I can only say that at the close of 1906 we seem
to have got rid of the devastating epidemic of small-
pox, but the Ulu Ai rebels in the Batang Lupar are

The Net Revenue and Net Expenditure for the
three rivers for 1906 is:
Net Revenue. Net Expenditure.
B. Lupar	$16,588.64	$26,021.80
Saribas	5,727.06	3,583.56
Kalaka	7,290.92	3,474.61
Thus the Batang Lupar shews an excess of Ex-
penditure over Revenue of $9,432.66, the Saribas a
surplus of Revenue over Expenditure of $2,143.50,
and the Kalaka a surplus of Revenue over Expen-
diture of $3,816.
The excess of Expenditure over Revenue for the
B. Lupar is less (by $581.84) than it was in 1905,
but the surplus for the Saribas and the Kalaka sur-
plus shew a great falling off amounting to a total of
$2,143.50, viz : Saribas less by $697.11 than it was
in 1905, and*Kalaka less by' $1,426.39 than it was in
1905.
The Net Revenue and Net Expenditure of the three
Rivers separately examined.
THE BATANG LUPAR RIVER.
1 .Net Revenue.
When compared with 1905 the Net Revenue for
1906 shews an increase of $453.02. and the Net
Expenditure a decrease of $128.82. It is a pity these
figures are so small since they are eminently in
the right direction.
To take the Revenue increases, shewing amounts,
we have:Court ($242), Military ($43). Plantations
($43), Licenses ($40). Farms ($205.), Prison ($205),
Timber Royalty ($109). The only satisfactory in-
creases in the above, so far as I can see, are in the
last two.
We have the following decreases in the Revenue:
Dyak Revenue ($206). Import Duties ($76), Ex-
emption Tax ($16), Cattle ($18), Currency ($201),
Probate ($111). The decrease under Dyak Revenue
is only what one could expect when so many move
out of the country, and the death rate was much
heavier on account of the small-pox. Ail the other
decreases are equally discouraging; under Exemption
Tax the decrease is small and owing to Malays
moving ftom Luuchong etc. to the 1st Division.
2 .Net Expenditure.
When compared with 1905 the Net Expendituie
increases are underOfficers Salaries ($746), Plan-
tations ($55), Cattle ($199), Prison ($224), Express
Service ($116), School and Education ($75), Pen-
sions ($120).
As regards the increase under Officers Salaries, five
Officers drew pay here for March ($940.) and partly
for April ($846.66) when Mr. Page-Turner was
appointed to serve in another Division.
* In June there were increases to the allowances of
the three senior Officers at Simanggang amounting
to $75 per mensem. In July Mr. Owen drew pa-t
of his pay ($70), and after that there were three
Officers only on the pay sheet drawing pay up to the
end of the year. The other increases call for little
comment. .
The net expenditure decreases are under:
Dyak Revenue ($32), Import Duties ($120), Court
($241), Military ($530), Puolic Works ($331), Police
ETTE, MARCH 4, 1907.
The falling off under Customs is very heavy indeed.
The Kalaka river was particularly unfortunate in
having several visitations of the small-pox epidemic
that quite put a stop to trade in some places.
The increases in the Net Revenue are under:
Assessment ($14), Court ($104), Timber Royalty
($11), and Pepper Tax ($40).
The last two are satisfactory but the sums are
but small.
2.The Net Expenditure.
Under Expenditure for 1906 the increases are to be
found under:Court ($88), Express Service ($28),
Military ($36), Native Officers ($60). Police ($26),
Post Office ($25), Prisou ($25), and Public Works
($555). The increases in Express Service and Mili-
tary may be attributed to the Chinese Secret Society
troubles, as also the increase under Prison. Under
Public Works the rebuilding of the Saratok Bunga-
low fully accounts for this increase.
The decrease under Expenditure shews in only one
item, in double figures at least, and that is.under
Cattle ($66). We cogld afford to pay more at this
station to have the Catule better looked after than
has been the case of late years, I am sorry to say, but
it is most difficult to get a cowman for Kabong.
CASH TRANSACTIONS IN THE
2ND DIVISION IN 1906.
The Kalaka Treasury transmitted to the Sarawak
Treasury $243 (old dollars), and cashed Letters of
Credit from Kuching to the amount of $2,030, and
farther transmitted to the Simanggang Treasury
$1,600. (cash).
The Saribas transmitted to the Simanggang Trea-
sury $1,563 cash.
The Sarawak transmitted to the Simanggang
Treasury $5,000 (new dollars).
THE 1906 AUDIT.
Mr. Ed. Parnell audited all the accounts of the 2nd
Division. The Books- in the Saribas and Kalaka,
: had not been audited by the Treasury for over 20
years, I believe. The errors were not very serious
i I may say.
EVENTS OF THE YEAR 1906.
Ulu Ai Affairs.
After various conflicting rumours, that the rebels
had collected a force for the purpose of raiding down
river in various directions but had again dispersed,
continued for the first three months to disturb the
peace of the country, at length, on April 19th, a force
of the Ulu Ai attacked Grinangs at Ulu Sreinat and
killed one man and sixteen women and children.
The rebels had three men killed near the house and
when retreating and after they had re-joined their
main force at ulu Kaung were again attacked by the
Sennat andKumpangDyaks, who had followed them,
and had three more killed. This force is said to
have been led by Amal alias Apai Biti who is a
refugee from the Empran, Netherlands India.
On May 16th the rebels made another foray on the
Lower Lemanak and attacked P. Sumpits farm-hut
which is only some 4 hours. paddle from the mouth
of the Lemanak. About 100 men attacked the hut,
led, it is said, by Kana eldest son of Apai Laja. Of
course these people came through the Lower Eng-
kari and were guided by an Engkari.
P. Sumpit beat off this attack after being himself
wounded in several places and losing eight killed and
one boy taken captive. The enemy lost three killed
and had others wounded. It was noticed that they
carried fire-arms and some twenty empty cartridge
cases were picked up near.
Since the above the rebels have constantly col-
lected forces which for different reasons (mostly
owing, I believe, to bad omens) have failed to under-
take any serious raid until just at the close of the
50	THE SARAWAK GAS
($153), and General Miscellaneous ($358). These
decreases in the last four items are of course very
satisfactory. Under Military a saving has been
effected chiefly owing to the fact that the squad of
S Rangers now employed does not draw so much
nay as the former one, and further that it was
reduced (by order). L nder Public Morks the saving
is effected owing to little work being performed by
outside labour, only certain small blockhouses had
to lie rebuilt at L. Antu as they were rotten, or had
to be removed because of floods.
THE SARIBAS AND KALAKA FINANCES.

1 The Net Revenue.
Compared with the Net Revenue of 1905 the Net
Revenue for 1906 shews small decreases under;
Dvak Revenue ($17), Court ($148), Currency ($140),
Customs ($118), Exemption Tax ($34), Plantations
($23), Probate ($300). It would be very much more
satisfactory were all these items, except Court and
Currency, to shew increases.
The increases for 1906 are;harms i$162),
Licenses ($21), Assessment ($18), Registration ($28);
the only satisfactory increases are under Hawkers
Licenses, Assessments, and Registration, and they
are all small amounts.
2 The Net Expenditure.
Under Expenditure the decreases are in Court
($103), and Military ($25).
The increases in Expenditure are found under:
Import Duties ($20), Native Officers ($23), Express
Service ($53), Pension ($25) and Police ($46). None
of these, except the first two, can be called
satisfactory.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, MARCH 4, 1907.
51
year when Ngumbang's son-in-low, and Bautin's son, got a force numbering, it is said, about 1,000 men and raided the Julau (in Rejang waters). I Imve heard from Lubok Antu (the news is from the Engkari) the rebels killed thirty persons and took five captive. I cannot, however, vouch for the accuracy of the above except that they did attack in the ulu Julau direction and have killed people there.
Upon their return Apai Bitis force started; it is said they blame Chendan and Embuas for their loss in April last at ulu Kaung and intend to attack them (they live near Wong Mutan above L. Antu). Merotim, Kling, and another from the Rejang came over to the Ulu Ai to persuade Ngnmbang, Bautin, and their followers to remove and come in at Kapit, but were unable to do so and returned to Kapit in July.
In November Ngnmbang, Bautin, Ugil, and their followers met Mr. Laug above L. Antu and stated they desired to meet me and Mr. Baring-Gould. I fixed a date in December and went to L. Antu but they neither appeared nor sent any explanations. I have since heard that Bantin' son and Ngumbang's son-in-law were leading the ulu Ai fi rc th it att ick i the Julau people (as I have mentioned above), so this accounts for their not liking to come to meet us at L. Antu!
MISCELLANEOUS.
On January 1st Uis Highness The Rajah Muda left Simanggang in his Motor launch for Lingga and Banting and returned to Kuching on the 2nd per p. s. Adeh.
On January 12th the heaviest flood ever-known occurred at Lubok Antu and Simanggang.
A great deal of damage was done at,the former place to the defences.
In March the Liew Chew Secret Society in the Ibus, Kalnka. the Sahari, Rejang. and in Kuching was discovered owing chiefly to the murder of Hugh Kui by members of the Society.
This Society was promptly broken up by His Highness The Rajah's directions and certain members were executed or imprisoned.
From July to October we were very short of both Officers and Clerks', there being only two of the former in the Division and one clerk in the B. Lupar.
CRIME.
Apart from the Ulu Ai country which is as it was last year (1905), in a disturbed state, there were, in the peaceful parts of the country, three murders and one cutting and wounding case.
The Secret Society committed one murder (it is said to be the third or fourth they are guilty of), a Chinawoman was murdered at Pengkalan Marnp, and a Chinaman at Sedio, Saratok.
APPOINTMENTS AND LEAVE.
Mr. O. Lang was appointed to the 2nd Division and Mr. Page-Turner to the 3rd Division.
Mr. H. L. Owen was granted leave home in July for 7 months.
Abang Lana was appointed in place of his father A bang Mesagus to be chief at Betong.
Tuanku Ali was appointed to Sabuyow in place of his father deceased.
Both the above appointments arc made subject to Your Highness approval.
P. C. Samsudin succeeded P. S. Bakir as Police Sergeant at the commencement of the year. P. S. Bakir retired on pension.

RAJAH MUDA,I have the honour to make the
following Report for the year 1906.
The net Revenue and Expenditure compared with
1905.
Revenue.	Expenditure.
1906	$13,204.98	1906	$15,478.77
1905	12,619.58	1905	14,142.29
Increase $585.44
Increase $1,336.48
This is the highest Revenue ever attained in this District. Ail items shew an increase with the exception of Court a/c which is a decrease of $97.60, Farms $407.50 and Land a/c $4.70.
Expenditure shews an increase of $1,336.08 mostly accounted for in the following items:
General Miscellaneous $ 114.70, Military a/c $354.41, Officers Salaries $407.53, Police a/c $81.48 and Public Works $373.28.
Public Works a/c shews the big sum of $2,080.16 mostly accounted for by the finishing of the following buildingsNative Officers house, Tatau: Clerk's house, Bintulu.
Health.Small-pox prevailed in Tatau for some months but was not of a very virulent form: the health of the Bintulu river has been good.
General.The state of the river has been quiet: one murder took place of a Chinese trader named Wai Kang, the murderer Tai Chang committed suicide directly after it.
A party of 36 Dyaks returned here in September who left here the end of last year, having been on a raid into the Kayan Country where they met with a reverse, losing 4' of their party. They have since been fined, the leaders $50 each and their followers $25 each.
At Tatau a number of Dyaks were fined for moving in from the Rejang without permission; these fines were paid and the people afterwards allowed to settle there.
Public Works.The following buildings have been finishedA house for the Native Officer at Tatau, Clerk's house, Bintulu, and a new bridge over the stream in front of the Fort built.
The roads and bridges in the Kainpong are in a very dilapidated state and I feel sure that a small tax levied on the Kampongs would be much more satisfactory than the present system of free labour, the people also would be glad of this change.
I have the honour to be.
Rajah Muda,

LAWAS.
January 30th, U)07.
RAJAH,1 have the honour to report as follows for this district for the year 1906.
Revenue and Expenditure.The Revenue and Expenditure for 1906 amounted to $8,626.4*2 ami $12,034.58respectively,showingadeficit of $3,408.26. As, however, a large* portion of the initial expenses for buildings and other works was included in the expenditure, the deficit cannot be considered a large one; during the ensuing year the expenditure will be reduced by $4,000 to $4,500. The station having only been started in May of the previous year no comparison can be made.
The larger items of Revenue consist of Court account $544 13, Farms $2,400, Customs account $4,440.37 and Exemption tax $824; and those under Expenditure are Public Works $4,715.42, Military account $1,451.19, Officers Salaries $3,131.83, Court account $825.98, Police account $720.52.
Farms.The Farms consisted of Opium, Spirits and Gambling which were rented at $200 per mensem. For 1907 only the spirit and gambling farms were sold locally, the opium farm having been included in that for the whole of Sarawak territory; the two former were sold for $190 per mensem or only $10 less than for the three including the opium. An offer was made to take over the three farms for this district for $300 per mensem, but as there is now no separate opium farm a sum of $1,320 has been lost to the revenue of the station.
Public Works.The sum disbursed under this head was $4,715.12, and in this amount was included part cost of the Government house, barracks, house at Merapok, wharf at the station, wages for roads, clearing and such like.
The estimate for 1907 is put at $750, all the larger and more important works having been completed.
Native affairs.Amongst the Bruneis and Kadyaus there have been no cases of any importance and amongst the Muruts only one, that of the death of one Riong caused by Gaing at Balang's house upriver. Gaing was arrested but made his escape before the final trial and from what evidence was brought forward it would appear that Riong attacked Gaing when drunk and Gaing killed him in self defence. The head of the house, Balang, and others, however, first of all attempted to conceal the murder and then, finding it was known, falsely accused one Lakai of having committed it. Balang and four other Muruts implicated were fined seven piculs.
The Muruts have otherwise been very quiet, no cases of feuds having taken place amongst them, such being at one time frequent.
A Dyak turned Mahomedan, named Musa, was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment for wounding, with intent to do grievous hurt, P. C. Puteh at Merapok.
The Dyaks living in the river have now, with a few exceptions, moved to the Gaya stream which they were permitted to do; this is a suitable part for them as they will not clash with the Muruts as might happen heretofore, they have so far behaved quietly and given no trouble.
I'ome six families of Bruneis have moved up to the station to live from the Pangeran's Kampong at the mouth, and have built houses' here; it is not probable, however, that many others will move any distance from the mouth as most of them are fishermen.
Trade.The Foreign Trade Returns for the year show the following figures:
Imports $80,390	Exports $67,057
As the station was only started in May 1905 only the latter half of 1906 can he compared with the cor
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE. MARCH 4, 1D07.

responding half in 1905 and this shows an increase in the Imports of $14,751 and ii the Exports o $8,094 or a total increase of $22,845, which may be considered satisfactory for the first year.
The chief articles of Export are Damar amounting to $56,889, India Rubber $2,557, Timber $2,224, and of Import, Rice $26,675, Tobacco $5,026 and Opium $3,300, by which it will be seen that dainar is by far the largest article of produce exported, there being very little India rubber or rattans left, these products having been almost worked out.
General.A concession of 10,000 acres of land for rubber was granted to Mr. Sargeant of Singapore in August, but this has not up to date been taken up.
A further concession was granted to Dr. Dittmer of 2,000 acres, which will be opened up as soon as a supply of labour has been obtained.
Six new shops have been built in the bazaar here and three at Marapok during the year, bringing the number to thirteen at the latter place and eleven at the station,
'Rainjall.The Registration of the Rainfall was not commenced until the middle of February and for six weeks from June 14th to July 31st owing to the death of Mr. Bingley and no one being in charge here until the latter date.
The total rainfall for remaining nine months amounted to 132.25 inches.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, MARCH 4, 1907.
From the above statement of Net Revenue and
Expenditure it will be seen that there has been a

in Expenditure of $1,214.58.
The principal amounts showing increases and de-
creases under Revenue are as follows.

Public House Licenses having been taken out.

Court ajc 1,795.This is entirely due to fewer
fines having been paid.

depreciated value of pepper, only 635 Agreements
have been made out in 1906 as against 1,031 in 1905.
EXPENDITURE INCREASES.
Court ajc 962.This is nearly entirely due to
Survey of district having been carried on for the
whole year instead of only 3 months in 1905.
Officers' Salaries a/c 695.Due to there having
been an extra Officer stationed here for some months
in 1906.

GENERAL REPORT.
His Highness The Rajah accompanied by the
Hon'ble H. F. Desbon A. D. C. visited this Station
on the 28th of July, leaving again the next day.
The Honble The Divisional Resident arrived on
the 25th of April and on the 26th passed sentence on
certain Chinese for taking part in a faction fight.
P. C. Ahmat who shot a man dead during the row
was sentenced to 10 years R. I.
A large Kongsee consisting of 118 Chinese, princi-
pally Lui Chews working for Messrs. The Borneo
Company at Bidi, were expelled from Upper Sarawak
early"in the year : they were a very truculent lot and
were undoubtedly members of a Secret Society; since
getting rid of these men there has been no further
trouble, nor has there been any gang robbery this
year.
The Fa Fooi lottery was started here in June and
close on $15,000 was staked in one month; it was
then closed by order of His Highness The Rajah.
The Opium Farm made a profit of $3,860 while it ran;
ibis form of gambling had never been allowed in
Upper Sarawak before.
Pepper Gardens.845 gardens paid Road Tax in
August but since then 40 have been taken off the
register, and many that have been allowed to go out
of cultivation have not yet been reported.
217 gardens weresold by Public Auction, in nearly
every case on account of the owners having abs-
conded after stealing the pepper which should have
been brought in to the persons who had advanced
I provisions, tobacco and prawn refuse against the
crop; the consequence is that many traders have
gone bankrupt, the person to score being the gar-
dener who, having obtained food etc. for a year free,
makes off in many eases with some $200 to $300
worth of crop, having illicitly sold which he absconds
from the country either to Singapore or Sambas.
Puak PlantationsI have been unable to visit
Puak for some months; the Gutta plantation is, I
hear, doing better than was at one time expected.
A small Hospital has been erected and there is a
Chinese dresser in charge so that sick coolies now
get prompt attention.
Survey. A Native Surveyor has been kept steadily
surveying the position of gardens and roads in the
district; that portion of the district bounded by the
river from Busau to Bau on the one side, and the
tram line from Busan to Buan and thence on to Bau
on the other is now complete; in all 425 gardens are
on the completed plan.
Crime.136 persons were sentenced to terms of
imprisonment in 1906 as against 105 in 1905.
The average daily number of prisoners and re-
mands were respectively, in 1906, 32.95 and 3.16,
and in 1905, 24.43 and 3.66.
Police.The force consisted of 1 Corporal, 2
Lance Corporals and 16 Constables stationed as
follows.Bau, 1 Corporal, 1 Lance Corporal and
13 Constables; Bidi, 1 Lance Corporal, 1 Constable;
Tundoug, 2 Constables.
There is also a Constable employed by the Opium
Farm both at Bau and Bidi.
Sarawak Rangers.The force consisted of 1 Cor-
poral and 5 privates; it was returned to Head Quar-
ters at the end of the year as it was not considered
necessary to keep it here any longer, gang robbers
having ceased to infest the district.
Public Works The old floor of the Siaat Sus-
pension bridge, which was rotten, was replaced by a
hiilian one.
The large billian bridge at Puak, which was on the
point of collapsing on account of the foundations
giving way, had to be hauled into position and re-
paired.
A new bridge was built over the Seniawan stream
on the Jambusan road.
The beams in the Court roof had to be replaced
and also the greater part of the floor, as they were
rotten, also considerable repairs were necessary to
His Highness The Rajahs bungalow.
' The roads were kept weeded and in fair repair by
contract.
Government grounds and the roads in the vicinity
of Bau were kept up by prison labour.
Staff.Mr. Page-Turner was appointed in June
to do duty in this district but was re-appointed in
July to the Rejang district, and Mr. Crocker was
appointed in October.
E. R. STILWELL,
Resident.
MUKA.
RAJAH,I have the honour to reportas follows to
Your Highness for the year 1906.
The Net revenue amounts to $15,133.43 ns com-
pared with $15,040.24 the previous year, an increase
of $93.19.
The accompanying statement of the revenue and
expenditure for the past two years shows the various
increases and decreases.
The principal event of the year was the visit of
Your Highness during the month of April; Your
Highness arriving on the 28th in the s. I. La Fee,
. and leaving next day in Your Highness' 8. Y. Zahora.
At the end of June I left for Kuching to attend
the Council Negri, accompanied by Mr. A. E. Law-
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, MARCH 4, 1907.
55
rcnce, the Assistant Resident, and Mr. I. Gordon White, the Officer in Charge of Oya.
Your Highness having been pleased to grant me two months leave 1 did not return to my station until September 13th, the Assistant Resident, Mr. A E. Lawrence, acting for me during my absence. , Mr. 1. Gordon White having been ordered by Your Highness to inspect the Matang Estate, the Assistant Resident, Mr. A. E. Lawrence took charge of Oya during the month of May, returning here on June 6th.
The trade of the district has been flourishing, this can be noticed from the fact that the revenue derived from hawkers licenses increased by $ 121 over the previous year.
The health of the natives has been good, the small-pox epidemic of 1905 having completely died out.
I have nothing further to report to Your Highness.
I have the benour to be,
Rajah,
Your Highness most obedient Servant.

RAJAH,I have the honor to make the following Report to Your Highness on the Revenue and Ex-
penditure, Trade and General condition of the Baram District during the past year of 1906.
Revenue and Expenditure:The total revenue collected here amounts to the sum of $27,459.82 and the
Expenditure to $24,306.87, thus leaving a surplus of $3,142.95.
The revenue is the largest that has ever been collected in this District exceeding that of 1905 by the
sum of $3,286.80, whilst the Expenditure exceeds that of the former year by $822.30.
If a growing Revenue is a sign of the prosperity of a country, the steady increases which have occurred
latterly ought to prove that the Baram District is one of the most prosperous in the country. I append
a table showing the Revenue collected and Expenditure in this District during the last 10 years.

If the items of Revenue are examined in detail it will be found that the chief increases occur under the following accountsCattle account $162.12; Court account $3,870.37; Kayan Revenue $1,281; Farms account $307.40; Public Work's account $291.65, s. 1. Lucile account $382.73.
Whilst the decreases are as follows:
Exports account $978.68; Currency account $465.84; Hawkers Licenses $200; Probate fees $218.74; Registration account $863.
1 am glad to note the increase under Cattle account as this year, for a change, the herd here have paid for their up-keep and even earned a small profit. The increase under Court account is chiefly due to the heavy fines imposed on the Bintulu Dyaks who invaded this District at the end of last
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, MARCH 4, 1907.

year, whilst that under Kayan Revenue is due to
the influx of Kalabits under the Sarawak Govern-
ment.
The Decrease under Exports account is simply
caused by the Niah Chinese shipping their birdsnests
to Kuching instead of Labuan, so the duty would ?
not be collected here. That under Currency account ,
is obvious owing to the fact that no old Dollars '
have been exchanged this year, whilst that under
Registration account js due to the fact that in 1905 I
ail the Niah Birdsnests caves were registered,
which brought in fees to the amount of over $900. [
Under Expenditure the chief increases are Court [
account $1,167.42, Express account $189.56, Police ;
account $558.73 and Lucile account $417.12; whilst
decreases occur under Military account $1,244.71;
Officers Salaries $250.97 and Public Works $664.64.
The increase under Police account and decrease
under Military account are owing to the increase in
the number of Police, whilst the guard of Rangers
has been correspondingly reduced.
The following figures will s tf w how the Revenue
and Expenditure is divided i*p amongst the Interior
and Coast districts.

Besides the above mentioned Revenue Export duty to the amount of $30,641 was collected in Kuching on jungle produce shipped from here, and Import duty on Tobacco and Kerosine Oil amounting to $5,184.56, so if these two items were to be included in the Returns from this district, the Revenue would reach the sum of $63,285.38, which, as the corresponding sum for 1905 was $48,037.76, shows a total increase of over $15,000, and a surplus over Expenditure of nearly $39,000.
Trade:I am glad to say that trade seems to be steadily on the increase and dutiable jungle produce to the value of $214,703 was shipped out of the district during the year.
India Rubber and jelutong continued to be worked in large quantities and 1,256 pikuls of the former and nearly 3,000 pikuls of the latter were shipped. An appreciable increase appears in Gutta Percha and Taram Rattans of which no less than 939 pikuls and 4,538 pikuls were worked as against 139 and 907 pikuls in 1905. Rattan Sega dropped from over 5,000 pikuls to under 2,000 pikuls, so I am afraid that it is true that this valuable rattan is be
ginning to be worked out.
The Import Trade shows an increase of nearly $2,500, and Export of over $5,600, whilst Foreign Trade Import and Export show a decrease $1,758 and an increase of $1,465 respectively. 1 should hke to note the substantial increase which has taken place in the trade of Miri which was nearly threatened with extinction in 1905, but now jumps to a total of nearly $30,000.
I append the necessary figures.

and settled, but none of them call for any special
note or were in any way what might be called
serious crime.
In the Court of Requests 283 summonses and
warrants were issued and the sum of $10,518.56 W'as
passed through Deposits in payments to creditors.
Public TForA'3;New Police Barracks for married
men were built at the beginning of the year and
consist of a good substantial house with bilian posts
and shingles; but as matrimony seems to find
favour in the eyes of the guardians of the Peace,
the accommodation for married couples will soon
have to be increased.
New Kitchens for the unmarried Fortmen and
prisoners have also been erected, thus doing away
with the unsightly hovels which clung to the Fori
hill overhanging the river and spoilt the appear-
ance of the station.
The Ridan Road has been prolonged another j mile,
and as the land there is being taken up by Chinese
and Malays for gardens. I have promised them at a
future date to make a road to the end of the point
where it will join the Kampong Road.
A New Road is also in course of construction from
the Police Station to connect with the Limbang
Road, which will divert a lot of traffic that at pre-
sent passes the Fort, which will be a great gain in
privacy and quiet. ..All the other Roads have been
put in a state of thorough repair.
General:Aban Tingang, the Kenyah Penghulu,
was dismissed from his office as being utterly un-
suitable for Government work, and Tama Lawai
Jan has been appointed to succeed him.
During the month of June a party of Rejang and
Bintulu Dyaks under oncBaong attempted to attack
the Kenyahs in the Silat R.; but as these people were
on the qui vive, I having already given them warn-
ing, the Dyaks evidently thought that they were not
strong enough and so passed on, without molesting
them, to the Batang Kayan R., from whence I hear
that they have since returned having suffered a loss
of 4 men killed.
Your Highness accompanied by Mr. H. F. Deshon
paid your annual visit to the station on June 16th.
Mr. King paid a visit to the Tipjar River during
October, whilst in November I went for a long tour
amongst the Kayaus, Kenyahs and Kalabits in the
Ulu Baram.
All the Kayans and Kenyahs living in the Pata,
Akar and Apoh Rivers have expressed a desire to
return to their old homes in the main Baram River.
I readily agreed to this, as it should be a very good
thing for trade, as well as making Government
work a good deal easier.
I regret to state that a Kalabit woman named
Sima Kayong has been killed by the Pa Mada Kala-
bits to whom she had been given by the Bah Kala-
bits as lawi. This is the only crime of violence
that has happened during the past year.
I am glad to say that the Malays of Claudetown
started farming this year, and as they appear to be
fairly successful I trust that they will continue to
do so in the future, as this will do away with a good
deal of the hardships of the landas.
The health of district has been good and no serious
disease has been prevalent during the year.
The rainfall for the year was 77.53 inches.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, MARCH 4, 1907.	59
The Revenue for the past year shows a satisfactory increase of $1,147.74 over that of 1005, the receipts under Courts, Licenses, Light House and Buoys, Farms and Prison being mainly responsible for the result.
Under Expenditure, the disbursements made for the erection of Court Writer's and Clerk's houses, for alterations and additions to Government buildings, for a paid mower in the ornamental grounds, for the purchase of materials for projected buildings to be undertaken in 1907, for travelling expenses incurred by the regular monthly visits of the Government to Dalat station, the transport of mails and other like outlay, are accountable for the increase.
Genera/.The chief event was the arrival of Your Highness on 27th February accompanied by Mr. H. F. Deshon A. D. c. on a visit to the Station. It was hoped that Your Highness would proceed up to Dalat in the neighbourhood of which live the greatest number of the population of this river and all of whom were anxious to s e and pay there respects to Your Highness. But it was not expedient for this visit to be undertaken as Your Highness left for Mukah first thing on the following morning.
During January Pangeran Sawar. the Imaum, died, and one Brahim, the former Belal, was elected to fill the vacancy.
One eventful occurrence was the arrival of the s. s. Sarawak which commenced running to this port in February in connection with the raw sago trade. Judging by the total tonnage of schooners entering and clearing from here this small steamer's running has not, as yet, affected the trade carried ' by them.
On the 1st of May I, acting under orders, left Oya for Kuching and Matang, having l een relieved by Mr. Lawrence, to report on the Matang Coffee and Tea Estate, and on its completion returned again to Oya on 6th June and took over from Mr. Lawrence.
Dyak affairs in the Uln Oya are in a quiet and settled state,
The cruel murder of two Bukitans, who had but lately moved from the Oya river into the Mukah where they met their deaths, still remains a mystery as no trace of the perpetrators has been found. Suspicion places the horrible deed at the door of the Mikai Pambars.
During the year some 750 cocoanut plants were purchased and most of them have been planted out along the side of the main roads which will be well shaded when the trees are full grown, and the general appearance of the station will be considerably enhanced by fine avenues of this graceful palm, not to speak of the probable benefit that will accrue to the station through their produce.
Trade Returns.The Export of raw-sago amounting to 325,400 Tampins for 1906 is far in excess of that for 1905, but the prices ruling throughout the year were low.
The quality of raw-sago worked here is extremely fine and gives but little, if any, profit to the producers owing to the wretched prices prevailing.
This industry is far from in a flourishing condition and perhaps measures might be taken to resuscitate it.

Officer in Charge.
UPPER Rejang.
February, 4th 1907.
RAJAH,I have the honour to submit to Your Highness the following report on the revenue, trade, and other matters in this district during the year 1906.
Revenue.The revenue in 1906 amounted to $59,036.72 which when compared with that of the previous year shows a decrease of $3,805-45; this is accounted for by a decrease in fines to the amount of $2,940.77, Imports p/c $2,390.28, and Exports a/c $2,270-55.
Expenditure.The expenditure which amounts to $58,479.41 for 1906 shows an increase of $7,437.40 which is accounted for by an increase of $2,193.23 in Officers Salaries account; $1,122.46 under Public Works account; under Military account $1,738.3-3; and $1,703.14 on account of repairs in Kuching to the s. 1. La Fee.
Trade.Owing to the prevalence of small-pox amongst the Dyaks during the first six months of the year trade was very slack, but I am pleased to bn able to report that of lata the trade has greatly improved. The Imports show an increase of $20,488, over that of the previous year, but the Exports a. decrease of $53,916. Large quantities of rice had to be imported during last year as the padi crop was an exceedingly poor one. Of jungle produce the principal exports were rubber 1,631 pikuls, valued at $ 33,938100, gutta percha $40,149.00, jelutong $43,108.00, rattans $38,017.00, and timber $57,137.00. More than half of this rubber was worked by Kayans and Punans in the upper waters of the Rejang river.
Public JForAs.The Lanai ig road has been completed, and it is now possible to ride from Sibu to the Lanang pepper gardens, a distance of about five miles. The road is in constant use, and much appreciated by the pepper gardeners. Good substantial bridges of bilian have been built over the streams.
The bridges on the Seduan road have all been rebuilt and all Government buildings have been repaired and put in good order.
After the expedition against the Dyaks of Poi and Machan in May, the Dyaks behaved themselves fairly well. An attempt was made by the Dyaks of Betas, in August, to attack the people of Baram, but they were stopped and the culprits heavily fined; but in December last several parties of rebels assisted, I am informed, by Dyaks from Dutch territory under Apai Beeti, made a number of attacks upon the people of Kanowit and Ngema, in which several Dyaks in the Rasau and Ngema. rivers wen killed.
The Ulu Ai Dyaks having obtained permission from Your Highners to live in the Balleh last May, a rush was made for that river by all Dyaks living near Kapit. and it was not until they found that the whole of the farming land in the Balleh had been occupied that this rush ceased.
A few have entered the Sut, and some say they intend to return to the Yong and Cher min rivers again after the harvest, as it is impossible to find sufficient land in the Balleh for their requirements.
I have the honour to be,
Rajah,
Your Highness most obedient Servant,
CHARLES HOSE,
Resident 3rd Division 60

February 6th, ISO*.
HEREWITH I append statement of Revenue and Expenditure for 1906 showing a decrease of $253.28 in the former and an increase of $1,754.03 in the latter as compared with 1905.
The principal decreases in the Revenue are in Licenses $300, Registration $251.25 and Stamps $482.48. The increase of $546.69 in P. W. D. is dne to the Lighting rate for Seniawan, which has been credited in the a/cs for the first time this year, and to Survey tees on pepper gardens. Road tax amounted to S2.S95.16, a small increase as compared with last year.
The chief increases in Expenditure are in Prison a c 290.34 and in P. W. D. $1,194.30. The increases in the latter are chiefly due to Telephones $301.31. Lighting Seniawan Bazaar $189.27 and Surveys of pepper gardens $181.70 (all new items) and an increase of $270.20 in repairs to bridges chiefly dne to the bridge at S. Stu being rebuilt.

February 13th, 1907.
RAJAH MUDA.I have the honour to report as follows for this district for the j'ear 1906.
Revenue and Expenditure.The Revenue amounted to $6,174.07 and Expenditure to $6,459.10 being an increase in the former of $1,592.87 and a decrease
in the latter of $2,114.48 or a nett increase in the revenue of $3,707.45.
Customs a/c shows an increase of $1,454.64 and Farms a/c. $360; in the expenditure the decrease is owing to that in Oflicers Salaries a/c. there having been no payments under this head for the latter half of the year.
Public Works.The sum of $775.21 was expended under this head, a decrease of $339.41, and the works chiefly consisted of repairs to buildings and up-keep of roads.
Trade.The trade returns for the year are as follows:
Imports $49,710 Exports $40,626 but as no returns were kept during the first half year in 1905, presumably on account of there being no. clerk here, comparison cannot be made for the whole year: For the latter half year corresponding with the same periop in 1905 the figures are as follows and show a substantial increase in the trade.
July 1st to December 31st 1906. Import* 920,029 Export* $17,049- ..	..	1906. do 10,144 do 7.618
Iiicrcae $9,885 Increaw 89.-131
or a total increase in the half year of $19,316.
The chief export was that of damar which increased from S900 in 1905 to $7,428 in 1906, for the half year, which alone shows the Muruts and others have taken to working produce again and good prospects for further increase in trade and revenue for the ensuihg year.
Native affairs.With one exception matters have progressed very quietly amongst the Muruts, the exception being that of the murder of one Akang which came before the Court in die early part of the year. The actual murder took place, however, at the end of the previous year but did not come to light until January, when information was given that Akang had been shot by Kading and had not died of smallpox. Kading was arrested, tried and found guilty, and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. Amongst the Besaya and Malay population there were nocases of serious crime or any that call for particular comment.
As remarked above many, both Muruts and others, are working produce again, having ceased or almost ceased doing so for about 3 years owing to the epidemics of cholera and small-pox'
Two large houses of Muruts from beyond Tengoa moved down to the lower waters during the year and more are to follow after the harvest. As there is a large extent of land between the Suang and Tengoa suitable for farming there is nothing to prevent many more from moving down.
Staff.Mr. Cox, who was in charge of the station for some years, being appointed to Bintulu I took over from him in May according to instructions from Your Highness.
I have the honour to be,
Rajah Muda,
Your Highness' most obedient Servant.

SADONG;.
February, 1907.
RAJAH MUDA,I have the honour to make the following report to Your Highness on the affairs of this District for the year 1906.
Revenue.The total net Revenue was $14,239.43. This would show a slight increase over that of 1905 but for the fact that some of the Native Officers were late in sending in their accounts and the amounts hqd to be credited in 1907.
The items that would have been affected were Licenses and Timber Royalty, both of which would have shewn increases instead of decreases as under. Fewer fines were inflicted ($L593.38 as against $1,884.42) and the greater number of fines imposed at the Colliery were not paid, the coolies being imprisoned.	Fees amounted to $887.50 against $851 in 1905.
Expenditure.The total net Expenditure was $15,504.26. This is an increase over that of 1905.
The chief increases are under:
Officers Salary $372.00
Court	273.62
Police	117.68
Public Works 2,618.71
None of these call for especial notice except the last which will be explained below.
The prisoners totalled 134 for the year and there has been an immense amount of work for them to ?do. One or two bad characters were sent to Ku- aching gaol.
I append a list of Revenue and Expenditure for the year.
Public Works.All roadswhich are unfortunately but few in numberand paths have been re-made and raised several feet above the original level to ensure their being above high water at spring tides. A new road has been cut through from the Bazaar to the rail and thence a short distance on in the direction of Sdiloo. Large quantities of stone have been brought from the Mines for this purpose, there being no material at hand, and the Manager of the Colliery has allowed special trains to be run on Sundays and holidays to bring down stone and slag. Roads are now in good order bnt of course will require repairing at intervals of some months to keep them so. No money has been spent in repairing the paths across river as the Hospital is likely to be removed elsewhere.
The Kampong road has been re-made in parts.
All the bridges have been rebuilt, they being in a tumble down condition. The ornamental grounds have been brought up to the new road by taking in an old sago plantation which has been cleared and grassed. All the grounds have been ditched and drained by ditches running inland to the Simunjan River.
Two Offices have been added to the Court thus giving a little more room. The Colliery Court has been rebuilt, it being quite rotten, and a small house built for the 2nd clerk in place of the old leaf attap
building at the wharf. The prisoners did a certain amount of work on Colliery roads and ditches and one bridge was built there, but Mine coolies soon fill up the ditches with rubbish and seem to prefer them so.
His Highness the Rajah having sanctioned a scheme for supplying Simunjan with drinking water from the Ngli mountain, no time was lost in carrying it out, and the supply is now complete. Some of the cost appears under 1906 Public Works, but the greater part has not yet been charged. This water will bring in a rate of $300 a year and the value of such a supply to such a place as this, which is flooded with muddy salt water at nearly every spring tide, cannot be too highly estimated. Water was previously brought 4 miles by rail in jars.
Court.There were a fair number of cases brought before the Police Court, the greater number being assaults by Mine coolies. The Pangarah of Mupuh was fined $300 for swindling Government in respect of Dyak Tax and keeping back a large amount of it. I fancy a good deal of this goes on among the Dyaks away on the Border buf it is difficult to detect.
A number of land cases were heard and settled, but land disputes among Land Dyaks are legion and many moremostly trivialremain unsettled still.
Wharf.His Highness having sanctioned the construction of a new wharf and shed when he visited the Station in May, the work was put in hand at once, the 1st pile 'being driven early in July. Fortunately there is a splendid supply of timber in the District. By the end of the year the sheds were completed and the wharf nearly so. The line of rail has been brought round in a curve to the sheds through which run a double line to facilitate discharging and shunting of trucks. At low water there are 19 feet outside the wharf and at spring tides 40 feet at the top of high water. The old sheds have been demolished and the site allowed to go io grass. The old wharves have almost entirely' disappeared.
Colliery.There was a change of Managers during the year, Mr. E: R. Naysmith taking over the management from Mr. J. Sage who returned to England. Mr. Maddocks came as Assistant and Mr. A. CoIledge, the engineer, was replaced by Mr. C. Lange.
The out-put of coal for the year was 19,573 tons 9 cwt.
The old and unsanitary coolie lines and Malay houses at No. 4 Mine have been razed and new ones erected and the ground round them partly drained. A great many other improvements have been made since the advent of the new Manager. Although there are so many hundreds of coolies working underground at the Colliery not a single fatal accident happened there. One coolie was killed by being thrown out of a hutch on the incline at No. 8 Mine on which he was riding contrary to regulations and several accidents happened on the line, though none were fatal.
Medical.The health of Simunjan has been good. Small-pox has been a good deal about in the Ulu,
62
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, MARCH 4, 1907.
the Dyaks being the sufferers there. Koran Kam- pong of Dyaks alone lost over 100 people and most of the other houses of Dyaks have lost from 10 to 50 people. Of course this has caused failure of the paddy crop in most cases and large Amounts of tax have been remitted (tide Dyak Revenue for 1907.)
However, I trust this visitation is now over and that 1907 will show no more deaths from the disease.
In the Hospital 325 patients were under treatment at different times, but the number on any day under treatment was never more then 14. This is satisfactory.
I append a list of patients admitted with the diseases for which they were treated :
Ulcers, cuts	and wounds etc.	209

Total 325
43 of the beri-beri cases were sent to Kuching Hospital, 59 were treated hpre and 6 others treated here died at Sadong. One Dysentery patient died.
Total deaths in Hospital here 7.
The Hospital is very inconveniently situated and its removal across river has been suggested, but I am awaiting the advice of the Principal Medical Officer on the subject before doing anything.

The export of Jelutong gutta, I am glad to say, is on the down grade. The sudden demand for Jelutong of course gave the natives work for some time but it has really done a deal of harm, the natives leaving then: work and taking heavy advances from traders to work this product. The result was that being able to obtain 2, 3 or even 4 dollars a day sometimes, they spent very much more as a native does, and ran up debts that could not be paid when the price dropped, as it soon did. Scores of natives are still heavily in debt to Chinese traders in consequence, debts that cannot easily be paid off. Now, when this gutta is difficult to work owing to the height of the trees and the necessity of tapping high up the stem, the people are turning their attention to other work and the export of sundries, sugar, rubber, fish and timber have all increased. A quantity of timber has been and is still being supplied to the Kuching P. W. D. All the timber used in the construction of the wharf was worked locallyPrapat, Truntom, Kapor, Encapang Pinang and Billian.
The Trade of the District is in a satisfactory condition and traders have built and are building new .shops in the Sadong Bazaar, great improvements on the tumble down houses previously erected.

General.Abang Apong was appointed Tuah of Gedong, Mersin was appointed Tuah of Gompi, Hj. Usop was appointed Tuah of Tabekang.
Mr. Ballingal started to open a rubber plantation in ulu Simunjan but had to leave on account of ill health. He reported favourably of the conditions for planting rubber and I trust he will return and carry out his scheme.
His Highness the Rajah accompanied by Mr. H. F. Deshon visited the Station on the 19th of May.
Messrs. Geikie and Hanny were prospecting for minerals in the Upper Sadong for some time during the year, but I do not know with what result.
The paddy crop down river is doing excellently and the Malays should have a good harvest. The Dyaks up-river will, I am afraid, be badly off for food, most of the bill paddy having failed though that in the swampy ground should prove a fair crop.
I have the honour to be,
Rajah Muda,
Your Highness most obedient Servant.

MONTHLY Report.
Upper Sarawak, paku.
December, 1906. '
Little of importance happened this month. The
small wharf sanctioned by H. H. The Rajah for
Seniawan was completed on 18th. The total cost
has been $154.84 towards which those Chinese
principally interested contributed $51.
. The prisoners were occupied most of the month
n* cutting about 8 feet off the top of the hill at end
Paku Bazaar. Formerly the road had a very
abrupt rise but now the gradient is quite easy.
At Seniawan about 4 A. M. on 23rd an assault was
committed on a small Chinese boy by one Voon Keyo*
By the aid of the owner of the house and another
man Voon Keyo made his escape while the police
who had been roused by the tremendous outer ' were
endeavouring to get into the house. Up to date of
writing the police have not been successful in arrest-
ing Voon Keyo who has now probably made his
escape to Sambas. The men who assisted him have
been duly sentenced in accordance with Your High-
ness' instructions. r
On the 24th I went to Kuching on short leave.
January.
On the 3rd I returned from leave, having walked up with Mr. Crocker.
On the 8th the squad of Rangers was sent back to Headquarters as thfe district has been quiet for a long time and no gang robberies have taken place since January last year when Malim was murdered at Musi.
On the 9th I called together all the parents of children whose names are on the school list, as I have noticed for some time that the attendance has become very small. The schoolmaster says the children are taken away by their parents to help work antimony, vrtjile the parents say the fault lies with the master who does not keep proper discipline in school. As things are at present it is waste of money for Government to keep open a free school. It would be better to make the schoolmaster a small allowance and allow him to charge a monthly fee or else make attendance compulsory. At Kranji there is a small school which always has a full attendance whenever 1 visit it, but the master is paid solely by fees.
On the 26th one Choo Paw Look was sentenced to imprisonment for personating a detective.
The prisoners finished cutting down hill at end of Bazaar on 11th and then weeded BuanRoad besides widening and metalling part of it that runs through a Dyak pepper garden now abandoned. On 28th they began weeding Ayer Panas road. The bank of the Ayer Panas pool is falling in and it will be ad risable to prop it up.
The Honble the Resident having granted permission to engage two men to keep the Seniawan Lidah Tanah road in order, this has now been done ai l they began work on 11th. There are now 5 men at a total cost of $75 per month keeping the main roads (10 miles) of this district in order. I have found this arrangement very satisfactory as regards the roads this side of Seniawan, each man having a certain section of the road to look after.
H. R. A. DAY,
Resident. OYA.
December, 1906.	, ?
General. The Pawn, Arrack and Gambling Farms for this district for the ensiling year were put up for auction and realized prices a little short of those of 1906.
Very little of moment or general interest has occurred this month.
Serious'charges of Malversation have been brought against Bujang, Tua Kampong of Medong, who for the last ten years has been the Tua of that kampong and who has up to the present borne a very good character and lias been highly respected by everybody.
Minute enquiries are being instituted: this case will come up for hearing shortly.
On the 22nd instant the Resident and Assistant Resident of Mukah arrived and on the 23rd proceeded to Sibu via Dalat, I accompanying them.
Courts.Both Police and Court of Requests were very busy during toe month. No case however is worthy remark.
Weather.Very heavy rain fell throughout the month causing considerable damage to roads and drains.
Health.-Influenza is very prevalent.
Trade.No raw-sago has been exported.
Imports	Exports.
$3,016.46	$2,480.45
January.
On the 2nd instant the Resident, Assistant Resident of Mukah and I returned fiom Sibu, the two former leaving for Mukah the next day.'
06 the 8th Abang Haji Taha, who proceeded to Kuching on the death of his father, the late Data Bandar, and who was detained there by affairs in connection with latter's estate, returned to Oya.
Mr. Cutfield arrived from Sibu on 11th instant to attend the Oya and Dalat regatta which took place on the 17th and 19th instant respectively and at which the Cut Band conducted by Father Anthony played a choice selection.
It is wonderful how the Milanos, practically ignorant of harmony and music, have been taught to accomplish what they do, and well repay the assiduous and indefatigable effort of the Fathers on whom the Band reflects the greatest credit.
On the 20th Mr. Cutfield returned to Sibu.
In addition to the charge of malversation brought against Tua Kampong Bujang, several of the Medong people accuse him of having sold gold-washed silver as gold for which high prices were paid. Inquiries are still proceeding in this regrettable affair.
I went up to Dalat on the 18th instant and returned to Oya at the end of the month, having a great deal to attend to.
I venture to write that the pressing necessity of placing a clerk at Dalat is making itself more and more apparent each time I visit this station.
To remove a clerk from Oya without considerably handicapping the expedition of work here cannot be entertained. An increase in the staff is the only remedy in my humble opinion.
Courts.In the Police Court some 17 cases were heard consisting of swindling, land, theft, etc. etc., whilst 130 cases were adjudicated on in the Court of Requests.
Fees amounted to $165.50.
Fines totalled $144.63.
One Haji Omar, a Sarawak Malay trading in Dalat, who was permitted after considerable trouble to take a second wife, one Dayang Isah, in August
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, MARCH 4, 1907.
last, returned suddenly from Kuching where he had been for the last 3 months and without any justifiable grounds divorced the said Dayang Isah.
His procedure in this affair no doubt is in accordance with the custom of this district; but that it is not permitted by the Mohammedan law is not, I believe, open to question.
This matter is Doing referred to the Divisional Resident.
P. IF. D.Prisoners have been engaged on the roads, ornamental grounds and in erecting a new cattle-shed.
Weather.Very strong winds have been blowing throughout the month; the last fortnight has been hot and fine.

December, 1906.
An impudent attempt to foist & palpably short
weight upon some Murut vendors of gum occurred
in the bazaar at Sloateng, and for expostulating a
Murut was struck savagely on the head by a Chinese
woman trader and some of the beads of her chaplet
broken. The assault brought the false weight to
the notice of the police and an exemplary fine was
imposed. Had it not been for this assault the false
weight would still be fulfilling its purpose, and yet
this is one only of instances which daily occur and
are not reported.
A number of buffaloes were brought over from
Li in bang and Trusan by land and sold to Muruts for
feasting purposes after the harvest.
The steam launch Pren arrived on the 14th
instant with Messrs. Davis and Dettiner and again
on the 25th instant with the opium farmer ot the
district.
The death occurred of a Brunei Malay at Kam-
pong Kuala from contact with a large Sting Ray
which was said to measure nine feet broad.
Private Mujah. S. R. was sent to Limbang on a
charge of insubordinate conduct.
The Exports and Imports were $6,915 and $7,572
respectively.	,
The rainfall for the month was 23.90 inches, the
greater part of which fell during the latter part of
the month.
January.
Complaints were made by opium smokers of the
quality and price of the drug sold by the Farmers
agent, when the latter admitted he was retailing
some inferior stuff taken over from the farm of last
year.
Some Muruts from Trusan were detected smug-
gling gun-powder for sale which they had previously
bought at Trusan Fort.
I visited Merapok from the 14th to the 18th instant
when 1 went to the Customs house at the Kuala
until the 19th instant.
The Resident Mr. Ricketts arrived in the s. 1.
?Gazelle on the 25th instant.
Pangeran Haji Ismail and Matassim from the
Kuala visited the Resident on the 30th and 31st
instant, when various matters were brought forward
by them for discussion.
P. C. Pali was dismissed the Police force.
The rainfall for the month was 5.68 inches.

ORDERLY ROOM, SARAWAK RANGERS
January 31st, 1907.
RAJAH,I have the honour to submit to Your
Highness my report on the Military Department
for mouth of January 1907.
His Highness The Rajab Muda arrived here on
January 17th and was received with a salute of
twenty-one guns and a guard of honour of one
hundred men.
On the 23rd His Highness, accompanied by the
Commissioner of Public Works inspected the Fort
and barracks, and ordered temporary repairs to be
done to the former.
His Highness expressed himself pleased with the
appearance of the new ban-acks.
Strength of the regiment.I enclose Your High-
ness a Parade Statement. During the past month
six privates have left time-expired, and ope L.
Corporal Goyang, having completed twenty-one
years service, has retired on pension. Four recruits
have joined. Bugler Agoor has been discharged on,
the P. M. O's recommendation as medically unfit;
he is suffering from chronic dysentery which owing
to his refusing to obey the doctor s orders whilst-iu
hospital has renderecPhim unfit for further service.
Conduct.There were three serious crimes during
the past month, two of them being asleep whilst on
sentry, and the third a robbery from a comrade.
Desertions.- One only. A recruit namedPte.Tiarn,
who only joined some four months ago, deserted on
January 5th. Having received information that this
man had returned to his home at Banting, I wrote
to the Resident Simanggang asking him to have
Pte. Tiam arrested and sent down to headquarters
under escort. This was done, and on his being
brought before the Court was sentenced by His
Highness the Rajah Muda to a term of imprison-
ment.
HealthA. good many men have been down with
fever, chiefly Sepoys, but no cases of serious illness
have occurred amongst the men here. The Resi-
dent Muka reports the death of one Pte. Auggah II,
one of the squad stationed therecause unknown.
Ammunition.Two hundred kegs of blasting
powder for use at Sadong mine have arrived; also
five hundred copper friction tubes for seven pounder
field, guns. Regarding the latter I hope now that
miss-fires with these guns wdl no longer occur, as
these new tubes are of a later pattern and packed
in better tins than those we had formerly.
Equipment.The new equipment, consisting of
one hundred Black Leather Belts and Braces, two
hundred Frogs for Sword Bayonets, two hundred
Black Leather Rifle Slings and one hundred Black
Leather Pouches, has now arrived and in eases*
where necessary has been served out. I propose,
subject to Your Highness approval, that some of
our older equipment should be sent to the out-
stations for use of the Rangers stationed at them,
as a good deal of the equipment now in use at the
outstations requires renewing.
The Fort.In accordance with His Highness
the Rajah Muda's instructions temporary repairs
are now being carried out to the roof of the fort.
These will, I understand, consist in putting a tin roof
on top of the present one, and will no doubt keep
the place watertight; but, on the other hand, we
shall not be able to place either any number of
men or a gun on top of the fort as was the case
before and which, in ease of any trouble arising,
would be a very useful thing to be able to do.
Barracks.The work of rebuilding the married
mens quarters (the ones near the Orderly room is
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, MARCH 4, 1907.
being carried on and should be finished during the
present month. There has been very little rain
during the latter part of the month, so the work
has gone on almost continuously.
Powder Magazine.The Instructor. Mr. Scott,
having reported that white ants were lining a lot of
damage to the kegs of powder stored in the two
magazines in fort, I inspected them, and, on lifting
the floors which consisted of loose bilian planks,
found tlie space between them and the ground one
mass of these insects. After having had both
magazines well cleaned out I obtained the consent
of the Hon'ble The Resident to have the floors
cemented, and as neither magazine is very large !
this has now been done at a very small expense. ,
On lifting the floors I also found that the ground ,
beneath was very damp, and this, coupled with the '
fact that the kegs containing the powder were con- i
stantly being eaten through by the white ants, has no doubt been responsible for the deterioration of I
some of the powder stored in these magazines.
The squads of Rangers lately stationed at Baku
and Bau have now been sent back to headquarters,
as I understand that everything being now quiet
they are no longer required at these stations.
I have the honour to be.
Rajah
Your Highness' most obedient Servant,
S. CUNYNGHAME,
Acting Commandant.
MATANG ESTATE
January.
During the month coolies have been employed to
supplying young coffee field and lending laboar in
weeding contracts, gathering coffee and tea.
The crops gathered during the month were 38 piculs parchment coffee and 267 lbs tea.
The balance of last years coffee and tea will be
despatched as soon as the coffee is sufficiently dry
and cleaned.
from the beginning of the year the rates of weed-
ing contracts have been reduced 25 cents per acre
per month with the exception of 14 acre field which
is always weedy.
The total amount of weeding contracts per month
$367.68 instead of $416.66 per month last year, a
reduction of $49.03 per month is being made till
the end of the year, and all lent labour has been
charged 33 cents per head instead of 30 cents as
hitherto charged.
Mr. Grove paid the Coolies wages for December
on the 4th instant.
J. M. GOMEZ,
Manager.
KAPIT.
January.
On the 4th I left for Kapit having spent New Year
at Sibu. On my arrival here Mr. de Rozario reported
that he had arrested a Dyak, by name Injah, who
was concerned in the murder or 5 Kanowit Dyaks
at foot of the Pilagus rapids and this man was sent
to Sibu on remand and the case has been fully re-
ported to the Honble the Divisional Resident of
the 3rd Division.
On the 16th Nyanggow of Ngmah arrived and
reported that a Chinaman by the name of Ah Ee,
from Kanowit, was killed in the Ngmah by a party
of Dyaks who are said to have come from Mikai
Pambar; I have reported this to the Honble the
Resident of the 3rd Division.
On the 21st I left for Balleh, going as far as the
mouth of Gat. 1 collected in a number of outstanding
fines and informed the Dyaks of Balleh that I would
visit them again in April, and divided out the land
for farming purposes as I had heard of nmny com-
plaints about certain Dyaks taking too much land.
On the 28th I started up the Mujong and entered
a branch of same called Tio in order to visit the
Punans of Bukit Batu. I met these Punans, and
they stated that it was the first time they had been
visitfd by a European; they number in all 13, and
seem to be dying out.
Mr. Cutfield arrived here during the month on a
visit.
The s. s. La Fee made 3 trips here and the Alice
Lorraine one.
I have nothing further to report to Your High-
ness.

Court.There have been the usual number of cases
in both the Police Court and Court of Requests.
Fines and fees amounted to $282.48
P. IF. D. - The prisoners (average 1909) have been
employed for the greater part of the mouth in work-
ing on the Oya road and repairing the bridges,
which have been much damaged by heavy rains; the-
road is now in good repair from end to end.
Trade.One schooner cleared for Kuching with
a cargo of 20 coyans of sago, rotans 10 piculs and
gutta percha 3 piculs.
No schooners arrived from Kuching.
General.On the 4th I returned from Sibu together
1 with the Assistant Resident, Mr. A. E. Lawrence.
The Officer in Charge of Oya, Mr. P. Gordon
White, arrived on the 6th to attend the annual re-
gatta which took place on the 8th, the usual lunch

UPPER SARAWAK. BAu .
January.
Agreements.116 have been made out during the
month. Stamp duties and fees amounted to $296.
Court.Fines and fees amounted to $447.78.
There is but little to report for the past month.
Mr. Crocker, Assistant Resident, returned from
Kuching on the 3rd instant and was relieved by Mr.
La Chard, Cadet, on the 7th, Mr. Crocker going to
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, MARCH 4, 1907.	67
Kuching to do dnty there. On the 25th Mr. Collins, I Cadet, relieved Mr. La Chard and took up his quarter in His Highness the Rajah's bungalow.
Dr. Barker P. M. O. arrived here on the 7th and having visited Bidi returned to Busau on the 9th; he also came up again on the 17th going on to Puak the same day. He arrived again on the 24th leaving on the 25th, andon the 31st bringing Dr. Bruce Lowe with him.
On the night of the 15th Tsen Choons house was entered and his box containing cash 915 and some clothes was stolen. The occupants of the house which is on a pepper garden were not aware of the theft till next morning.
On the 24th Boo Chin's house at Puak was entered at night by three Chinese, having beaten him atid his wife severely they left again. Boo Chin stated the men were strangers from Seniawan and he only knew them by sight, I, however, bear that there was a woman at the bottom of the matter.
Eo Tek Seng, the Kangchew, was severely reprimanded for not reporting this assault at once; he left it for Boo Chin to do when ne was sufficiently recovered, which was not till 7 days after. The Kangchew was warned that he will be removed from his position should such a thing occur again.
It is worthy of note that considerably more pepper has been exported from Sarawak in 1906 than in 1905; this bears out what I have reported before i.e., that last years crop was an exceptionally good one, the shortage in pepper delivered to persons entitled to the crop has not been consequent upon a poor crop, but simply the effect of illicit selling of the ?crop by the gardeners.
The prisoners average 174 have been employed ?on up-keep of roads and grounds, etc.

January.
On the 1st, New Year's Day, the usual games and boat races were held and a dinner given in the Fort to the chief men of the District.
Court.There have been the average number of cases but mostly petty ones.
A Tatau Dyak Kaya was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment for theft of cash and various ornaments from a Langkow and afterwards burning down the hut whereby a lot of property was lost.
Tamban was sentenced to 3 months for breach of contract, and Senis Dulla and Ajak to six weeks each for contempt of Court.
On the 31st Ajak escaped from the prison gang but was recaptured the same night.
The next morning it was reported that some other Kadayans who were wanted in Court for debts had absconded by boat, so this man had most likely arranged to get away with them as he is also a Kadayan.
On the 9th a meeting of the Pandan Punans was held to elect a new Chief in place of Tama Anni, a very old man; Tama Jan, bis son, was elected.
On the 15th the party of 35 Dyaks, who lately arrived here from the Batang Lnpar without passes, were sent to Kidurong to await the steamer to return them to their own country : they did not get away till the 22nd, by p. s. Kaka-, they lost one of tbeir party and there was a good deal of sickness amongst them while waiting, most likely caused by eating poisonous crabs and shell-fish, as they were eating sorts which coast people will not touch.
The s. s. Sarawak only made one trip during the month arriving on the 31st.
Imports amounted to $2,907, Exports $4,006.

Simanggang
January.
Ulu Ai Arfairs.Mr. Lang with the relief guard (two boats) left for Lubok Anta on the 5th and Mr. Baring-Gould being relieved returned to Simang- gung on the 7th.
Writing from L. Anta on the 12th Mr. Lang reported that an Engkari Dyak had just come in with the intelligence that a force of the Ulu Ai Dyaks under Imba (Ngumbang's son-in-law,) and Renggah (Bautin's younger son)which was said to number about a thousand menhad returned from raiding ulu Julau (Rejang.) They killed there thirty-one persons, and, it is said, took some prisoners; these raiders only lost two men.
This story confirms my surmise in my December Report that Ngumbang. Bantin, etc., would not come to meet me at L. Antu as Imba and the bulk of their followers were out on the war-path.
Directly this force had returned Apai Biti's (Amal) followers went out. I understand that their intention was to raid the Dyaks under Embuas (nephew and adopted son of the late P. Baran,) and Chendan, who live near Wong Matan, as they accuse them of having joined in the night attack made on their force ut Ulu Kaung last year when they were retiring having raided Grinaug's house in the Sremat (below L. Antu.) 1 have never heard before that any of Erabuas people were concerned in attacking these Dyaks. Part of Apai Bitis force came down the main river-as far as Karangan Maung but seem to have retired on account of bad omens. They did not move ont again during January.
Kana, son of Apai Laja, and Ramba, son of the ex-Pengulu Ngelengkong (who some nine years ago was banished to the Rejang at the unitd request of the Ulu Ai tuai,) came to Lubok Antu to talk about surrendering to the Government; both these young men say they have houses of their own (in theDelok Lalang), the former has nine doors and the latter eight doors; they make the same statement that they wish to come in but their followers do not and that they will try to persuade them, and return again to report progress in another month! Ngumbang, it is stated, has now a very large house and following in S. Sumpali, Delok. All the Ulu Ai people are said to lie living chiefly upon topioca as there is little or no rice to be got; this, however, teems uncertain.
Appointments, etc.Subject to Your Highness approval I have appointed T. Ali second son of the late T. Bagus to succeed his father at Sabuyow.
1 have suspended Abang Aiyu of Betong until further orders for unsatisfactory conduct as a Native Officer at Betong Court.
Mr. Is Chard arrived at Sinmnggang on the 31st, per p. s. Adeh, having been appointed to do work in this Division.
Miscellaneous Matters. There seem to have been a number of unfortunate accidents, involving several deaths and loss of property, during January.
Sajai of Bangkong's house, Melugu, Dor, reported here on the 9th that he had shot two young Dyak women, by mistake, having taken them in the laiang grass for a kijang deer. The Snider bullet passed through the shoulder of the nearest girl and came out through the upper part of her arm, and, carrying a fragment of her bone, pierced the next girl through the breast to a point a little above her heart. The first girl died 12 days after being wounded but the other girl recovered very speedily after having the piece of bone and bullet skilfully extracted at Banting by Mrs. Dexter Allen, M. B.
Duyau, a Dyak widow living in Ulu Lay ar, was very seriously wounded by a bamboo pig-trap which pierced her thigh just above the knee. This trap was set by one of her own people in Abuts house.
OS
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE MARCH 4, 1907.
When the woman is able to attend Court the case will be heard at Betong.
Dundang, the tuai rumah of Upper Sepak, Sribas, reported the accidental death of Tedong of his house. The deceased, an old man, bad climbed a pingau tree in order to gather its leaves to useon the farm, when he somehow slipped and fell on to two upright stubs which went through his heart and caused in* stantaneous death.
Jangi's house (eight doors) at Tinting Bungkang, uiu Padeh, was destroyed by fire whilst all the inhabitants were absent weeding on their paddy farms. Valuable old jars and brassware estimated at over $2,000 were destroyed and nothing was saved.
Private Tiani S. R., a Balau Dyak recruit, who enlisted June 19th 1906, deserted to his home at Chabu, Banting, on January 5th and was followed up by Police Sergt. Godom who traced him up the Strap river and arrested him on the 16th and took him back to Headquarters the same day.
Ah Jim of Sabu village reported that his house was set on fire outside by some person or persons unknown on the night of January 19th. He lost all his paddy and most of the contents of his house which was burnt to the ground. The Police examined the remains of the house and it seems most probable that the fire was caused by the inmates themselves.	.
Drabman (ex-Corporal S. R.) formerly of Galaus house, a Banting Dyak who turned Mohamedan some years ago, together with two Saratok Malays, his friends, went to Banting and were there found to be selling what the Malays call tangkal padi, or charms to protect the paddy against ravages by rats! This ancient superstition that charms can be used to protect the paddy has long been exploded in other places, but it seemed to appeal, somehow, to the Banting Dyaks (in spite of the advances they have made in civilization') and they flocked to purchase the meaningless scrawls (not even verses from the Koran!) on pieces of paper rolled up in bamboos which were to be put up on the farms. The price charged was eighteen cents, or one fowl, for each charm, and this would have brought in a goodly sum but befo re it was collected the Police appeared and removed the petty swindlers to Simanggang where they subsequently spent their time, more profitably and economically, in cleaning and repairing the roads.
The dry weather during January enabled (he prison gangs to clear out most of the ditches on the plain, and to repair the two main roads from Sabu and Brayun to Simanggang The average number of prisoners working was 27,06.

The case against four Adang Muruts and others for being concerned in the theft of six old Jars and other property valued at $800 again came on for hearing; there was, however, no evidence to show that the prisoners had stolen the property and on this charge they were acquitted; the Court held one Seman and the four Muruts responsible for the goods, they having agreed to take charge of them. Seman and the Muruts have gone to Madihit to try to recover the jars if possible.
The other cases brought up were connected with disputes in reference to sago lands and claims for damage to paddi crops by buffaloes.
One Madi, a Kadyan, who was detained pending rial for having taken away a quantity of his wifes
I
private property, made his escape through the care-
lessness of the guard on duty.
On the 14th I left for Brooketon returning again

On New Year's Day the usual sports were held and passed off with good feeling and hilarity to the mutual satisfaction of competitors and onlookers. The Government boat won the Long Boat Race for the first time for several years.
Penghulu Ringgir arrived from Bakong on the 14th and reported various matters to me.
On the 17th Mr. King left to visit the Coast Stations vid the Uhl Bakong Road. He returned again on the 27th and reported that everything was going on well at Niah and Sibuti and that the people were up at the caves gathering the birdsnests. He also handed me in the result of his enquiry inta the charges brought by Pangeran Akup against Orang Kaya Sabang of Niah. It was found that none of Pang: Akups charges were proved or had any substance in them so he was fined the sum of $25 and warned to mind his own business in future.
On the 23rd 1 received news of an affray in the Upper Rejang below Belaga Fort in which two Punans and a Dyak had been killed.
Hi Bawang, the Kaiabit chief of the Upper Tutau, arrived on the 28th and paid in his tax. He reported that he had met Ballang Tawi the Pa Kabak chief and that now that the Kayan force had withdrawn from the Ulu Baram, the latter refused to pay in the fine of $300 inflicted on him for attacking the Pa Butong Kalabits.
Orders were issued to the Police to strictly search all boats going to Balait in accordance with the Order re Export of the new Dollar.
There has been a good deal of Court work during the month and several rather important cases were held.
Abong, a Dyak, was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment and banishment from the District for defying the Government and for constantly annoying the Kenyahs.
Chop Hap Ann were fined $25 for breach of Order No. 1. 1885 re receiving money from Dyaks.
Raman, a Brunei, charged another Brunei by name Tundak of enticing away his slave Rebaha. This case, which caused great excitement amongst the Brunei traders, was not proved, but Tundak was fined for holding improper conversation with Rebaha, who was allowed to free himself on the payment of $36.
The prisoners have been employed on the new road at the back of the Fort, whilst the coolies have cleared the cattle field and repaired the fence.
A prisoner named Jarum died on the 2nd and a mad-man named Sait, who had been detained in the lock-up on account of his violent behaviour, suddenly expired on the 7th.

level approximately 100 feet.
Note.For the present we discontinue to publish the observations of temperature and of rainfall taken at the Museum. Early in February it was found by actual measurement that the raingnagc was faulty and this unfortunately has been the case since 1891. The rainfall recorded from the Museum has been uuiformly too low but it becomes approximately correct if multiplied by 1'19.
Records taken during the last twenty days with a correct guage shew that the rainfall at the Museum is practically identical with that at the observatory. The temperature observations taken at the Museum are quite correct but they do not give so fair an indication of what is ordinarily understood as shade temperature as do those taken at the observatory seeing that there is not free circulation of air in the neighbourhood of the Museum thermometers.
