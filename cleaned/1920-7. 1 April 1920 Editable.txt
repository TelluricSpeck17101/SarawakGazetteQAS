Dr. Luhn and Mr. Mead visited Lundu in the s. l. Lucile which started on the 27th and returned on the 29th.
Apparently the weather has not yet settled down to calm, for a bad sea and N. E. wind prevented the Lucile from going out over Santubong bar for some hours and gave her a decidedly lively passage both to and from Lundu.
THE out-put for the month of February at Bau Cyaniding Works amounted to 1,300.1 ozs. gold and 367.8 ozs. silver.
When speaking at a meeting of shareholders of the British North Borneo Company on December 23rd 1919 Sir West Ridgeway touched upon several subjects which should be of interest to those who wish to see the natural resources of Sarawak developed to the advantage of the country and its inhabitants. From the report of his speech on that occasion, as it appears in The British North Borneo Herald of March 1st 1920, extracts are reprinted below.
It is an additional recommendation of the nipa sugar and timber industries that practically all the labour required for both can be supplied by the natives of this country, whereas to some other forms of work, such as that of labour on rubber estates, they have never taken kindly.
SUGAR AND ALCOHOL.
There is every prospect that the next few months will witness the introduction of another new industry into the Territory. Three years ago I alluded to our extensive nipah palm resources. It is surprising that hitherto nobody has been sufficiently enterprising to turn them into account in the manufacture of sugar and alcohol, as had already been done in the Philippines. Mr. Matthews, our Conservator of Forests, has furnished some useful statistics, which were recently published in various newspapers. including the Board of Trade Journal", but the notice attracted little attention in this country. It has been left to a group of more enterprising financiers in Canada to come forward with proposals of developing these resources, and, while it is yet early to speak with any certainty, we may, I think, look forward to this industry being firmly established in the Territory before long.
TIMBER.
It will interest you to know that the timber industry is in a healthy condition. Mr. Wood, the Acting Conservator of Forests, reports that if more tonnage could be secured the exports could easily be more than doubled. A new line of Australian steamers is now calling at Sandakan, and this will mean a much larger export to Australia. We understand that the heavy duty on manufactured timber imported into Australia has been reduced ; if this is the case, North Borneo timbers should find a ready market in the Commonwealth, which has in the past absorbed large quantities of construction timber from Canada and the United States.
STEAMSHIP COMMUNICATION.
I have already referred to the advent of a new line of steamers calling at Sandakan en route for Australia. It will interest you to know that the fleet of coasting steamers maintained by the Sabah Steamship Company is to be improved and enlarged.
Visit of Japanese Admiral.
On Thursday the 18th March, H. I. J. N. S. Nisshin and Tone arrived in Sarawak waters, the former flying the flag of Rear Admiral Kiyokaze Yoshida commanding the Second Foreign Service Squadron. Owing to the size of ships it was not considered safe for them to come up to Kuching, but on Friday morning the Admiral, accompanied by Captain Tsunematsu of the Tone, Captain Yeguchi of the Nisshin, Engr. Cdr. Aoyagi, Lieut. Cdr. Yasutomi and Lieut. Sasaki came up in a launch. A salute of 13 guns was fired from the fort on their arrival. On the pengkalan to meet them were Messrs. Boult and Lang, and a guard of honour of 50 Rangers under the command of Captain S. Cunynghame. Representatives of the Japanese community in Kuching were also present displaying their national flags. As soon as the Admiral stepped ashore the guard presented arms, while the band played the Japanese Anthem, all present paying the usual marks of respect.
After inspecting the Guard the Admiral, accompanied by his officers, proceeded to pay an official call at the Residency where the Acting Resident received them in the absence of His Highness the Rajah who was then away on a visit to Sadong and Sibu and could unfortunately not get back in time to greet the guests. This call was returned at the house of Mr. Hayashi which the Admiral had made his headquarters for the time being. An official dinner was held at the Residency in the evening at which the principal Europeans and Japanese were present to meet the Admiral. Afterwards the entire party crossed over to the Astana where H. H. the Ranee was at home and where a number of ladies had already assembled to welcome the visitors. A display of Dayak dancing and some Indian juggling brought to a close a very enjoyable day. On Saturday evening a dinner was given by Mr. Hayashi at which we understand a large and representative company was present. At 1 p.m. on Sunday the visit came to an end and the Admiral and officers returned to their ships by launch, a farewell salute being fired as they passed out of sight down the river.
It is interesting to note that the Nisshin was, with the Kasuga, originally built in Italy for the Argentine Republic but was purchased by Japan during the Russo Japanese war, and taken direct to Japan from the builders. Her heavy armament includes four 8-inch guns, and she would, we believe, correspond approximately to the British County class cruisers, none of which, however, are now in active commission.

Court.But few cases have been before the Courts probably owing to the advent of Chinese New Year. The following are those worthy of mention.
Ah Chong was fined $210 for selling rice above the controlled price and without a dealer's license.
Buan Heng was sent to gaol for nine months for theft and attempting to bribe the police and Leong Nyuk and Sin Tho were imprisoned for three months each for theft and returning to the district against enters. Lee Mook also went to gaol for four months for stealing pepper, and Arip for three months for gross contempt of Court.
Public WorksThe prison gang cleared the falls on and repaired the Buan road. They also finished levelling the site for the clerk's bouse and almost completed the site for the new police barracks. A considerable quantity of timber has been collected for these buildings but no belian posts or attaps for the new barracks are at present obtainable here. I understand the tenders for the construction of the barracks are being called for in Kuching, the plans being in the hands of the Municipal Department. The sooner these buildings are put in hand the better as the existing barracks are not fit for human habitation.
The new bridge across S. Kredam below Siniawan has been constructed by the P. W. D. Kuching.
The old bridge was completely demolished by a huge enkabang tree falling across it.
The survey of the district has temporarily ceased owing to the withdrawal of the surveyors for reasons recently set forth in the annual report of the Survey Dcparment and also owing to the weather being so had that the survey coolies were unable to do their work properly and they were consequently paid off.
I trust that this important work will again be taken in hand shortly as until it is completed no system of land revenue collection can be begun.
General. I went to Kuching by road on the 8th returning by launch on the 10th. The road this side of Batu Kitang is fairly good but the first two miles on the Kuching side of that place is nothing better than a buffalo wallow in most places, which renders any form of locomotion difficult to say the least of it.
Mr, Hamilton of Peak had his steel trunk full of European clothing stolen from his bungalow on the Kith. No trace of the thieves was found.
The day before Chinese New Year I examined most of the shops in the bazaar for small notes and coin as complaints were coming in of a shortage of this form of currency.
I found practically every shop had ample supplies of both copper and notes, more especially of the former which was obviously being kept for gambling at Chinese New Year.
Chinese New Year passed off very quietly. There was practically no cracker firing and the bazaar was quieter than I have ever known it.
Licenses were issued to dealers in rubber in the various bazaars at the end of the month and regulations concerning the same published as notices.
Since January, by local order, rubber has not been bought or sold outside the bazaars, the immediate result being that no reports of thefts of rubber have been made for some weeks past. It is to be hoped that the licensing will put a stop to the thieving altogether.
The theft of tapping cups continues. A Chinaman was caught carrying a sack of them past Buso Police Station at 4 a. m. one morning and he is now in Bau gaol.
The Conservator of Forests arrived at Bau on the 25th returning on the 27th to Kuching.
The price of nee rose to $1.60 a gantang on the 1st. Owing to the news having reached the bazaar before I heard of it a little trouble ensued but the stocks of rice were confiscated from a few of the shops by the police, one shop-keeper was fined and the excitement ceased.
I opened a Government shop in Bau bazaar on the
27th for the sale of rice to ticket holders at ?th rations at 90 cents, and these must draw a full month's rations at one time. Having no one else to put in charge of it the second clerk was taken from the Court to look after the shop.
Food is exceedingly difficult to obtain. Fowls and ducks are but rarely obtainable and only then at very high prices. Pork is scarce but the price remains at 72 cents. Fish is not obtainable with the exception of the usual salt fish from Kuching, while every other form of foodstuffs is rapidly rising in price.
Vegetables are still to be had though not as plentiful as usual for some reason unknown.
I fear the immediate result of refusing cheaper rice to shop-keepers will be a rise in the price of everything they sell, this giving them the necessary excuse. They have raised prices excessively as it is and the new arrangement will cause a still further rise.
As most of the shop-keepers here are pepper and rubber garden owners and, as shop-keepers, not practically well off, the majority are being allowed the cheap rations.
The drawing of the distinction has caused considerably dissatisfaction which is not worth while
incurring for the small extra expense to the Government which it involves, while, as I have stated, it will serve to raise prices, by which the whole communityespecially the poorer part-will suffer.
The padi crop is still being harvested. The weather has been favourable and reports on the crop are excellent, neither birds nor insects taking the toll they have in former years.
The price of opium was raised to $8 a tahil during
the mouth. Local stocks were checked and an account sent to Kuching before the rise in price was made known.
The rainfall for the month totalled 472 inches. The weather has been exceptionally dry and hot for the time of year.
The out-put from the Cyaniding Works amounted
to gold 1,300.1 ozs. and silver 367'8 ozs.

SIMANGGANG.
February.
On the 6th Messrs. J. A. H. Hardie and W. F. Dick accompanied by Abang Haji Buassan left for Lubok Antu, the s. l. Hong Line towing them up as far as Engklilih. Lubok Antu was reached next day. Mr. W. F. Dick returned to Simanggang on the 12th and Mr. J. A. H. Hardie on the 14th, reporting having held on enquiry into the destruction of the barracks and Native Officers' quarters by fire.
The few pepper gardens at Lubok Antu are well kept and vines look healthy.
Most of the penghulus visited the station, when a
number of outstanding cases were settled.
It has been arranged to put up four doors of the
new barracks on the hill near the fort, Native Officers' quarters a little further away and four doors for fortmen and the clerk's house on the old site.
Final instruction were given to Chinese about erecting the new bazaar at Engklilih.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, APRIL 1, 1920.
On the 7th Abang Emit, Native Officer of Spaoh, Saribas arrived with a complaint that Paku Dayaks wished to fell the jungle behind Spaoh kampong in order to plant tip the land with sago palms. One cannot get Malays to make a move in felling jungle, they will tell you they mean to but never do so, thereby keeping those who really want to from doing the work. Malays and Dayaks have been warned continually that they have no right over virgin jungle. Abang Emit was informed that the matter would be looked into when next an officer visited the Saribas.
P. C. Matsalleh arrived from Engklilih on the 12th with the escaped prisoner Chin Neu who was caught by a Malay. Chin Nen received the usual punishment.
Court work has been heavy, there being a great number of jelutong road disputes. These were all examined and settled.
One Liow Than was sentenced to one year R. I. for harbouring an escaped prisoner. Chong Kee one year R. I. for deliberately destroying pepper vines out of spite. Kaw Liang lined $100 for receiving stolen pepper.
It was reported by Entulang Dayaks that 4 Poi Dayaks of Batang Rejang and 1 Lemanak Dayak were
working jelutong. These 5 men by name Kaiar of N. Merluan, Kanowit, Pong. Nglambai and Jurai of Malaccas Ho Poi all state they left Sibu about 2 years ago by steamer to Sadong, and from Sadong went overland to the Entulang.
The Tuai Rumah in whose house these five Dayaks
are living has to report to the Government each month as to their behaviour.
The 20th being Chinese New Year was observed as a public holiday.
On the 24th the offices were closed it being the anniversary of Her Highness the Ranee's birthday.
All natives have started harvesting and as far as I can gather the crop is an exceptionally good one.
On the 26th accompanied by Mr. J. A H. Hardie, Abang Dulrasid and Draup of L. O. we left for the Skrang reaching Nanga Enteban at 6.30 p. m.
Next morning, making an early start, we walked to Damats house spending the night there and the following morning getting as far as Buaw's in ulu Plasok. Mr. J. A. H. Hardie, accompanied by various Tuai, climbed B. Banggat to try and get some idea of the extent of land in the ulu Entaban, as there has been a long dispute between Buaws and Ujais people, I walked on to Isekshouse, Mr. J. A. H. Hardie following later. In the evening, with due consideration, a boundary was fixed between Buaws and Ujai's people.
Saribas.The clerks quarters at Betong are still uncompleted on account of the difficulty in getting planks.
The Court work was very light, natives being busy harvesting.
Kalaka.On the 5th the s. 1. Moratebas arrived, clearing again on the 7th with 1,100 piculs of rubber leaves.
Penghulu Nuga reported the death of one Ujoi by a pig trap set by Jebin of the same house. This matter will he looked into when Saratok is next visited by an officer.
The arrack farmer was had up in Court and warned about adulterating arrack, there being many complaints from Dayaks.

February.
I was absent from the station until the 16th.
Mr. H. D. Aplin reported, on my return, chat the five Bintulu payaks who had been sentenced to death were executed on the 4th.
On the 9th, a youth named Poh Ah link stabbed a woman, named Angok, and one Sim Bun Thong, both of whom succumbed on the same day. It appears that Ah Hok had been cohabiting with Angok and suspected the woman of having other admirers. In a fit of jealousy he killed the woman and then amoked. On being met by the police he threw down his weapon and gave himself up.
Poh Ah Hok was tried for murder before live assessors and found guilty; he was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment.
A Foochow, named Wong Kung Tung, mysteriously disappeared; he was last seen st Binatang. Kung Tung is said to have left Binatang by the night tide to return home but never arrived Hottie four days later the boat he had been using was found adrift and empty in the Loba'an.
In my report for January, I mentioned that a Skapa'an named Tama Lasah was said to have been accidentally drowned in the rapids. A party of Skapa'ans recently visited Kapit and reported that Tama Lasah did not meet his end accidentally but had been killed by a Dayak, named Baring. Baring, who originally reported the death of Tama Lasah to the Government, has been placed on remand pending an enquiry to be held when an officer next visits Kapit.
The Tuah Kampong, of Selalang, reports that his house was accidentally burnt down and Government cash amounting to $97.88 was lost. Mr. W. R. Tudor Clement, who left for Matu and the other stations in the Delta on the 18th, will investigate the matter.
The 24th, being the anniversary of Her Highness the Ranee s birthday was held as a public holiday and the flagstaff dressed in honour of the occasion.
Chinese New Year fell on the 20th, which day was observed as a public holiday and a salute of seven guns fired.
On the 21st, I left for Bintulu, picking up Mr. J. B. Archer en route. Bintulu was reached early the following morning after a somewhat rough passage.
On the 23rd, a Penan, named Imang was arrainged before the Court for the murder of a Chinaman, named Ewe Ah Kok, in September last. The assessors with one exception, brought in a verdict of not proven and Imang was duly acquitted.
From Bintulu, I proceeded to Mukah and Oya and was still away at the end of the month.
At the request of the Resident of Mukah and Oya, $50,000 in notes was remitted from the Sibu to the Mukah Treasury.
There has been little work in the Courts during the past month as all the Malays and Dayaks have been busy harvesting their padi. It is not, expected the whole crop will be harvested for at least another month. There are good reports for every part of the district.
In some places the illipo nuts have fallen and could be collected but the Dayaks will not leave their padi farms till the harvest is over. In all probability the greater part of the nuts will be devoured by wild pig, which are very numerous.
A wireless message received on the 25th to the effect that the price of had again risen. Oya and Mukah were communicated with by telephone and instructions to all sub-stations

in the Upper and Lower Rejang, to check the opium in hand.
The s. s. Gladys cleared for Singapore on two occasions and the s. s. Flevo once only, during the month.
The total export trade for the month, in quantity and in value, is far above the monthly average. 4,472 piculs of jelutong and 183,733 tbs. of para rubber were shipped.

LOWER REJANG.
February.
I arrived at Matu on the 18th. Owing to the fact that several people were away working in their farms, there was a slight decrease in the number of cases brought before the Court, and those chiefly related to disputes of ownership of land.
On the 5th the schooner Sri Sandiikan bound from Mukah for Kuching with a cargo of raw sago and jelutong was wrecked on Pasir Wak a sandbank off of the mouth of the Matu. The schooner was in a leaky condition. The crew were saved and a certain amount of the cargo salved.
The sum of $11,037 was remilted to the Sibu Treasury.
A visit was paid to the light-house at T. Sirik. This was found to be in good order, but requires a fresh coating of paint. After visiting Daro I left for Rejang. An enquiry was held at Selalang as to how the house occupied by the Native Officer Haji Gusti and Government monies therein was destroyed by fire. The minutes have been duly forwarded to the Honble the Divisional Resident. The light-house at T. Jol mouth of the Rejang was inspected. Owing to the sea encroaching it is necessary that this light-house, be removed further inland
I returned to Sibu on the 13th.
W. R. TUDOR CLEMENT,
Resident 2nd Class.
OYA.
February.
General.According to orders received I sent an
armed police guard to the Cut on the 2nd to receive certain boxes from the Sibu Treasury said to contain $50,000.
There were sent over to Mukah on the next day and were handed over to the Treasury there. On the 4th Mr. H. L. Owen arrived from Mukah returning to that station again on the 8th.
$500 in 25 cent notes was sent to Kuching during
the month.
I left for Dalat on the 11th returning on the 14th.
Whilst there I had the new gambling regulations read out in Court; the rent of the gambling farm has been raised to $50 per mensem, a rise of 100% on the old rent and 400% on that of last year. The 20th being Chinese New Year, the offices were closed and a salute fired at Oya. On the 21st the s. 1. Chamois with the Honble. the Divisional Resident on board arrived off the qualla, and I proceeded by her to Bintulu on official business according to instructions. I was away until the last day of the month when the Honble, the Resident Mr. H. L. Owen and myself arrived in the Chamois.
Police Constables Awang Arun and Aman were dismissed the force, the former for petty larceny and
the latter for gross neglect of duty.
Court.- A. man known as Tuanku Brahim alias Inchi Brahim alias Brahim Radin of uncertain nationality was sentenced to 2 years R. I. for theft of about $300 in cash. This man seems to have been travelling round the country and earning a living by swindling. He has, at various times, posed as a Javenese medicine seller, a Pelembang sarong hawker, etc. and appears to have succeeded in taking in the stupid Melano. Since the sentence I have heard that this man is supposed to be the same as one calling himself Malini Gajah who has been perpetrating various swindles and selling guns in the Tatan district. The Resident of Bintulu is sending over some of the complainants to Oya to identify the man. Tuey, an elderly Melano woman, was fined $50 for deliberate trespass on a sago land ; this is the second time in 3 months that she has been fined for this offence. Chui Im was fined $25 and his license stopped for a year for trading in a kampong and partly living there (third conviction). There were the usual number of cases in Oya and Dalat but none of much importance.
Rice Control.On the 1st of the month the people
began to register and obtain their rice cards. Only about a third have registered. I hope this is a sign that the local padi is beginning to come in but the probable cause for the shortage is the extreme distrust with which Melano receive any new order or regulation. They are most conservative in their habits and dislike anything new. The Dayaks have begun harvesting and rejiorts are good. The few Melano who have farmed seem to have very good crops and Kampong Senau have harvested already. The up-river Melano have farmed very little and prefer to buy imported Vice. I hope to report more fully on the harvest in my next month's report. Rice was being sold at the Oya Government Rice Depot at $1.60 per gantang.
P. W. D., etc. The prisoners (a very small gang)
were employed as usual. It is getting increasingly difficult to keep the grounds and roads in good order. Paid labour is hard to obtain on account of the high price of sago flour and jelutong. A rice godown was built under the Court house at Oya.
Trade.There were exported during the month
Raw sago	...	52 koyans
Jelutong ...	40 piculs
Exports for Feb. $15,877 Imports for Feb. $17,862
Total to date 36,067 Total to date 38,581
One steamer and two sailing vessels entered during
the month and two sailing vessels cleared from the port during the same period.

with the mandor amounted to two only. A few repairs wore carried out in the cow-herds house, two boats were re-painted and the hedges and fences of the ornamental grounds attended to; a small boat intended for river work was also completed.
The telephone inspector resigned at the end of the
month and Hernan, who states he has had experience
in Kuching, was engaged temporarily.
General.Chinese New Year and Her Highness
the Ranees birthday fell on the 20th and 21th of the
month and were duly observed as holidays.
During the month H.H.S.Y. Zahora left and took up mails twice, s. s, Sarawak arrived and cleared twice and the s.l. Chamois came ami returned from Sibu. The weather throughout has been fine and rainfall amounted to 5'81 inches.

BINTULU.
January.
On the 3rd H. H. S. Y. Zahora called off Kidurong
and dropped a mail and some much needed stores. For some time the bazaar had been without many necessities, including tobacco. She called a second time on the 19th on her way back from the North. Later in the month the s. s. Sarawak entered the river: her cargo included 50 bags of rice which should be sufficient for local consumption until the new harvest is gathered.
Court. The case of Wee Kee was re-investigated.
It will be remembered that in December a skeleton of a man was dug up and it was thought probable that this was the remains of Wee Kee who disappeared some seven years ago. Two men were arrested at Baram who had been originally suspected and were brought here. The evidence was gone over again and the bones and especially the skull was examined by the two Native Officers and two Chinese assessors. The evidence against these two men was insufficient to convict and they will be sent back to Baram when opportunity occurs. Wee Kees children refuse to admit the lames are those of their father.
Other cases related to disputes about sago land and fruit trees.
The site of a new Dayak house in the Binai, about which some complaints have been made, was examined and no reasonable objection was found to a building being placed there. The Native Officers say that no pad: has been planted on the land for over six years.
The weather through the month was rough, but not sufficiently so to prevent the larger fishing boats finding their way out.
Rainfall amounted to 2318 inches.
A. E. LAWRENCE,

The Honble. J. Baring-Gould and myself arrived by H.H. S. Y. Zahora at Bintulu on the 7th and on the following day I took over the station and cash from Mr. A. E. Lawrence who left in the afternoon.
Court.No important cases came up for settlement during the month. In accordance with my instructions Penghulu Beti and those involved in the murder of four Batang Lupar Dayaks (reported in December) were called and the sentences passed at Sibu were read to them. Bu, Anyang. Liang, Ina and Lawang were sentenced to death (and had already been executed). Utiek received five years and Sirai, Agok, Daud and Bun three years imprisonment respectively. Penghulu Beti was dismissed from the Government service and fined $1,000, while the remainder were fined $30 each. All fines were paid within seven days. The weapons of those who had come down armed to the fort had already been confiscated by Mr Lawrence and were sold by public auction. It is to be hoped this prompt and well-merited punishment will stand as a warning in this river for many years to come.
The Honble. the Resident of the 3rd Division and
Mr. J. B. Archer arrived on the 22nd and on the next day the evidence in the case of Ewe Ah Kok, murdered in the upper Labang (reported September), was reheard before new assessors. A verdict of not guilty was returned against the two accused, Imang and Lab. In an appeal case Karabas vs: Mud the land in dispute was ordered to be divided.
P. W. D.No important work was undertaken
during the month as the prisoners available to work
February.
Very few cases came before the Courts: Tama Kalang, a Long Pala, was imprisoned for two years for causing a penyamun scare in the Tutau while the remainder were mostly cases for breach of farming regulations.
Fines and fees amounted to $567,86.
Tuanku Drahman. Native Officer went up the Baram river as far as Penghulu Alum Wan's house to buy rice and padi.* He obtained 330 and 2,100 gantangs respectively.
The Kayans as far as Bawang Takun, Dayaks of Poyut and Bakong have been ordered to pay their tax in padi. This should be sufficient for Goverment consumption for a year.
There should be enough padi in this district for the natives, but not enough to supply bazaar Chinese. Who will require about 700 bags to last them until end of landas.
The arrack farm was sold by auction for a period of three years from August next at a monthly rental of $345. This is an increase of $227 per mensem.
News was received from the Tutau that a Bah Kalabit had killed a Pa Bawan. This was confirmed by a letter from Tama Aping Nipa, Murik chief at Lio Matu.
It appears that the Pa Bawan, thirty in number, came across to ask lawi from the Bah Kalabim. which was paid up and all were quite friendly. The Pa Bawans returned leaving two of their followers behind and for no reason Lawai, sou of Pun Bechera, killed one, but did not obtain his head.
I will make full enquiries when I visit this district in May.
I left for Miri on the 5th instant returning again on the 9th instant. On my way I put up channel marks at Baram mouth, 5 feet was obtained going and 12 feet on return. Sea was very calm.
Tama Tijau Anie, Tama Anie Deng Belulok, Gumbang and Penghulu Aban Blaweng, up-river chiefs, paid visits.
Mr. and Mis. Crommelin, Mr. and Mrs. Wells and Messrs. Munniks de Jongh and Joy of the A. S. P. C., Miri came here to spend Chinese New Year.
Mr. Andreini left for Miri on 22nd instant to discuss private affairs with Honble. Resident 4th Division.
Tama Lim Kebeng, a Long Watt, was warned that he would be heavily fined if he settled any more cases in his village.

Resident 2nd Class.
LIMBANG.
January.
The 1st was observed as a public holiday.
Mr. W. F. de V. Skrine arrived here on the 5th to do duty in this division, he visited Danau from the 9th to the 13th ami reports on up-river affairs as follows: I proceeded to Danau on the 9th instant in the m. l. Damit the journey taking seven hours on account of the river being in flood. I met the two Bisaya chiefs Datu Orang Kaya Pemancha and Orang Kaya Lantang who reported few outstanding cases and everyone busy with their padi farms.
I held Court twice, the only case calling for mention being that of Kanyan, a Dayak vs: Kibut, a
Bisaya, on charge of buffalo stealing: there was however insufficient evidence to prove actual theft,
so at the request of the chiefs, Kibut, who has often
been accused of buffalo stealing, was ordered to search for the missing buffalo, or refund the value of it. It was also found necessary to fine the Dayak
Kanyan for illegal seizure of Kibuts property, mid
for keeping his buffalo outside the pasturage without permission.
Several disputes over the ownership of sago clumps were heard, and, the actual ownership being doubtful, it was decided to sell them by auction ; these disputes invariably occur when the price of sago rises.
A number of debt cases were satisfactorily disposed of. During my stay I inspected local padi farms and found the padi looking very healthy, and
in some places they had already commenced harvesting.
The chiefs however bitterly complained of the inroads of pigs and monkeys and asked permission to purchase more gun-powder.
The buffalo fence around the Government grounds having become very delapidated, I arranged with Orang Kaya Lantang to have it thoroughly repaired for the sum of $20. I inspected the Government buildings, groundsand property, and found all in good order.
Accompanied by Mr. Skrine I left here on the 17th to visit Brooketon and Labuan and was absent
until the 23rd Mr. Skrine remaining in Labuan on short leave.
Mr. J. Hatton Hall accompanied me from Brooketon in order to obtain copies of certain papers
connected with the lease of the Brooketon Colliery.
These were supplied and after discussing various matters relating to the above he returned to Brunei in the m. l. Damit the following day.
There was no steamer from Kuching during the month.
H. H. S. Y. Zahora called twice at Brooketon and
left mails from Kuching for Limbang.
The s. s. LAubaine made one and the steam launch Cecile three trips during the month in order to take the local produce to Labuan.
Court. The following were the principal cases: Dukang, a Bisaya, was fined $60 for divorcing Ah Soon her husband by civil marriage.
Ah Gam was sentenced to three months H. L. in default of payment of a line of $25 for libel.
Selapan, a Kling, to three months H. L. for living with Bisayas contrary to orders.
Kai Seng to three months H. L. for theft of sago our and vegetables.
Fines and fees amounted to $241.10.
P. W. D.- The coolies were employed on the Sebukang Road, cleaning out ditches on the golf course and trimming the bamboo hedges.
The prisoners worked on the Berawan Road and weeded the paths and ditches in the ornamental grounds.
The following are the trade returns for tho month:
