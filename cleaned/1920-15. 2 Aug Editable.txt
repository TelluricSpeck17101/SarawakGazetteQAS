ON the 24th. July at Kuching, Sarawak, from septic pneumonia following influenza, it. JOHN SOMERVILLE OXIKIB in his 41st. year. (Singapore papers please copy.)
WILLIAM LEDINGHAM CHRISTIE. M. D.. F. R. C. S.. died on the 22nd. July and was buried at sea in the Gulf of Suez.
NOTES.
(July.)
WE learn that His Highness the Rajah intends leaving Sarawak en route for England in September, and that His Highness the Tuan Muda will probably arrive here in December next.
RACE week this year has naturally not been so festive as usual but we feel sure our visitors from Miri and other outstations bare appreciated our sentiments and realize that it was not through any lack of hospitality that the dances at the Sarawak Club and the New Club were cancelled and that they were not entertained as much as they have been in other years. His Highness the Rajah gave a dance at the Astana on Friday 30th. July which was a great success and much enjoyed by everyone. The Rangers' Sports which were as popular as ever were also held on Friday and the results of these appear in another column. The tournaments are still in full swing and are being keenly contested and we hope to give the results of these in our next issue. On the whole Race Week has not been so dull as we feared and although there may have been some shortage of soda water there does not appear to have been any lack of more stimulating drinks.
171	THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, AUGUST 2, 1920.
WE publish below a letter received from Fraser & Neave, Ltd., which will we trust reassure our readers.
To the Editor of the Sarawak Gazette
Dear Sir,
WE are indebted to you for opening the subject of the scarcity of our products and we thank you in anticipation for the opportunity of elucidating the cause of that scarcity.
"Dame Rumour is a lying jade" we are led to believe, and in both her efforts quoted by you she has amply sustained her reputation. Our relations with our agents are those of complete confidence and any blame which may attach to anyone in the matter is ours.
The sole cause of the shortage of supplies is the shortage of bottles, especially Codds bottles it has been, and is now, a cause of great anxiety to us and we have done our best to meet every one of our clients, though we have not always been wholly successful.
We can, however, assure you that the demands of Sarawak will always receive our best attention.
MR. H.S. B. Johnson and Mr. and Mrs. J. O. Maddocks arrived from the North by the p. s. Adeh on the 13th July. She sailed again on the 17th. for the North with Mr. and Mrs. J. O. Maddocks.
THE s. s. Kuching arrived from Singapore on the 23rd. July. Among her passengers were Messrs. J. H. Wright, C. Fenwick, W. R. B. Gifford, P. Smith, Mrs. J. S. Fenwick, Mrs. W. T. Clark, Miss Clark and Master Clark.
MR. C. D. Adams was a passenger from the North by the p. s. Adeh which arrived on the 24th. July.
THE S. S. Kuching sailed for Singapore on the 25th. July. Her passengers included Messrs. J. W. Evans, H S. B. Johnson, L. T. Thring, P. H. ONians, J. M. Bryan and Miss M. A. Thring.
THE p. s. Adeh sailed for the North on the 28th. July. Passengers by her were Messrs. P. C. W. Cobbold and Parker Smith.
The death of Mr. J. S. Geikie
Words can hardly express our deep sorrow and the gloom which has been cast over our small European Community by the unexpected and almost sudden death of Mr. J. S. Geikie on Saturday morning the 24th. ultimo, after a short illness. It was only on Friday, the 23rd., that those living in Kuching heard that Mr. Geikie was very ill and that Doctor Luhn had gone to Bau to see him. He was found to be so ill that it was decided to bring him to Kuching Hospital at once where he arrived the same day, but his condition became more serious during the night and he died about 10 a. m. on Saturday from septic pneumonia, following on influenza. Only on the Friday before he was staying for a night with Mr. Bryan at B M. K. having come down for a week end, and he then appeared to be all right.
Born on 31st. July, 1879 at Edinburgh, the deceased was the second son of the late Professor
James Geikie, L. L. D., F. R. S. of Edinburgh. He came out to this country in July 1902, just 18 years ago, to join the Borneo Company's staff at their gold works at Bau. Of a genial and kindly nature, a thorough sportsman, a favourite with all who knew him, his sudden death in the prime of life has come as a tremendous shock. To his brother Mr. W. H. Geikie and the other members of his family, the fullest sympathy will be extended in the great loss which they have sustained, a loss which is deeply felt by his many personal friends in Sarawak.
The funeral took place on Sunday morning at 8 oclock, the cortege leaving the Pavilion Hospital a few minutes before that hour. His Highness the Rajah and all the Europeans at the time in Kuching, as well as several, who came down from up-river, walked behind the coffin to the S. P. G. Cemetery where the deceased was laid to rest. The short service at the grave-side was performed by the Venerable Archdeacon Small.
Retirement of Mr. J. W. Bryan.
The retirement of Mr. J. M. Bryan whose departure from Sarawak is chronicled in another column represents another severed link with the past. He first arrived here from the London Office of Messrs, the Borneo Company, Limited, in February, 1897 at which time Mr. E. J. Smith Was Manager in Sarawak with the late Mr. C. D. Harvey as Chief Assistant. The former retired soon after and the latter was appointed Manager. Mr. Harvey's state of health, however, necessitated an early retirement, in October 1901, and Mr. Bryan succeeded him in the post which he has held ever since ; probably a record in promotion and the youngest Manager the Company up to that time bad ever had in the East.
Soon after bis arrival in Sarawak Mr. Bryan began to make his presence felt as an fill round sportsman and whether at tennis, golf, billiards, bowls, cricket or football, as a horseman, or with a gun, there were few here who could equal him and none who could give him points. In the old days when Race Meetings were held it was seldom that he did not have a stable full of ponies in training for himself and his friends, the successes of the B. M. K." stables adding considerably to his reputation, and incidentally to his stock of racing trophies. Generous and hospitable, his Race Week and New Years Eve parties have been a source of enjoyment for many years and will be long remembered by those who were not too old to dance. Mr. Bryan's departure is a distinct loss to our community and we take leave of him as an old friend wishing him many years of life, happiness and prosperity in the homeland, hoping that perhaps be may in the future give a backward thought to the years and pleasant times spent out here and to the many friends who with feelings of regret have seen him depart. Here's to J. M. B.!
Retirement of Mr. H. S. B. Johnson.
The retirement of Mr. H. S. B. Johnson removes from among us another Government Officer who joined under the old twenty-one years term of service. He first arrived here in August 1897, not quite 23 years ago, during which time he only took European leave twice, in 1908, under the old ten year mile, and again in 1913.
Appointed a Cadet on joining, Mr. Johnson was attached to the Third Division for the first twelve years or so of his service, doing duty in the Upper Rejang first, and later in the Lower Rejang. In
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, AUGUST 2, 1920.	172
1911 he was appointed Acting Resident of Baram, in 1912 Acting Resident of Mukah and Oya, and in 1911 Acting Resident of Limbang, where he remained until his retirement, being appointed Resident of the 5th. Division in February 1915.
A good sportsman. Mr Johnson in his earlier days used to ride in the Races held annually in Kuching, and his services were always readily given on the handicapping and other Committees. These days are now gone by, but we hope that in his retirement he will have some pleasant memories to look hack upon, and that he may live many years to enjoy some of the good things of life in the old Country where our best wishes go with him.
Sarawak Rangers' Sports.
The Rangers annual Sports which took place on the 30th. July were held, on the old cricket ground, which was found to be much cooler than the parade ground where they took place last year.
His Highness the Rajah was present and a large number of Kuching residents and visitors from the outstations tilled the stand.
There were plenty of entries and all the events were keenly contested.
The Bandsmens nice was the most amusing. The big drum made all the running but was caught in the straight and easily beaten by the cymbals
The native sightseers were not as plentiful as in past years but this is accounted for by the fact that the event was allowed to lapse during the war and that they did not receive long notice of it this year.
At the conclusion of the sports Mrs Cunynghame at the invitation of His Highness the Rajah gave away the prizes.

The late Mr. J. S. Geikie.
In writing an appreciation of John Somerville Geikie the difficulty of adequate expression seems to tower so high as to render, such a task well nigh impossible.
The life of the man, his very nobility of mind indeed the simplicity of his whole character forbids the use of platitudinous phrases which after all would convey nothing fresh to those who knew and loved him and would be. the last thing which he himself would wish.
The great majority of his friends in Sarawak knew him as a man of unusual ability, but it was given to the few who had the privilege of working in close association with him to realise to the full the great depth and activity of his intellect, chiefly in connection with his work but at the same time capable of being directed towards any subject in which he might for the moment be interested.
His intense dislike of talking about himself quite precludes any non-technical man from understanding to what extent, the gold mine at Bau owes its success to his efforts.
For many years past his has been the guiding influence in technical matters, and whenever a difficulty has cropped up his has, in nearly every instance, been the brain that has solved it.
Probably the most notable instance of this occurred some ten years ago when the type of machine, then in use at Bau and in other parts of the world was considered to be allowing too large a loss of gold in the tailings. New machines of a different type were therefore ordered and installed, but in the mean while Geikie was at work on a conception of his own, and following the failure of the new installation an experimental machine to his design was erected and put to work with complete and almost immediate success.
The designs were then sent home and several more similar units ordered and installed, and have been at work ever since with uniform success
This in itself was a noteworthy achievement but the skill knowledge and patience which were brought to bear on the problem of carrying a new and in some respects revolutionary idea to practical success can best be judged by the light of the remarkable fact that in scarcely one single detail has it been found necessary to modify the original design and the machines at work to-day are almost exact replicas of the experimental one erected ten years ago.
There can be no doubt however that his natural bent was Geology: and indeed it is fitting that it should have been so in view of the fact that he was the son of a father whose reputation as a Geologist was world wide and chat his uncle was elected President of the Royal Society in recognition of his learning and knowledge in that branch of Science.
Here again perhaps the best proof of Geikie's outstanding capacity and intellect is to be found in the record of his achievements.
In November 1905 there was read before the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy a paper from his pen entitled The Occurrence of Gold in Upper Sarawak . Its reception by that body as shown by the resulting discussion only goes to show that had he wished he might have laid the foundation of an eminence equal to those if his father and uncle. It may be that it was his intention to devote himself solely to the study of Geology after the mine at Bau, now so near its end. had finally closed down, but of that we cannot tell.
The proof however that his paper excited more than common interest in mining circles is forthcoming in the fact that shortly after its publication
173	THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, AUGUST 2, 1920.
he received from a firm controlling very large gold mining interests in India, the offer of a lucrative appointment in that country; an offer which to a man of his calibre could scarcely have failed to result in the attainment of that form of success so dear to most men and so little valued by himself.
He refused the offer; his reasons being that he had formed friendships in Sarawak and was very happy in the enjoyment of his work where he was, and many years later when talking on the subject, he would say Well I have done my work here and have been happy.
Happy" ! Perhaps that word is the key-note of the simplicity of his character and it surely is, to a large extent, key-note of his unbounded popularity.
He has passed.
To his acquaintances there must always remain the memory of a fine man, but the very lives of those whose privilege it was to know him intimately cannot fail to respond, possibly unconsciously, to the influence of the memory of a character so uncommon in its strength and simplicity.
Letters to Editor.
THE EMPIRE MEMORIAL HOSTEL.
Wanted -A Million Half Crowns.
To the Editor,
Dear Sir,We want to endow this Hostel, the need for which is very urgent and very pressing, and the site for which is already acquired. It is a terrible reflection for us, who owe our very lives to the sacrifices of our Merchant Seamen, that when they come into the Port of London, hundreds of them are unable to find a decent bed, a decent meal, and decent recreation, which is all they ask for. All the existing Hostels are crowded out and are turning hundreds of men away every night, and the result is they are driven to the haunts of vice which abound in the districtwhich exist indeed to prey on these men, or else they can only walk the streets. And these are the men who saved the Empire.
We cannot all give large sums but most people can afford 2s. 6d., and we want to get a million half crowns in order that the Memorial Hostel may be opened as soon as possible. There can be no delay in paying the debt that every person in this Empire owes to these men.
Yours truly,
(signed) SOMERSET.

Mr F. G. Day is pleased to receive, acknowledge and forward any donations sent to him for the above appeal.
Defeat of White Ants.
?
The system at one time nearly always adopted and still frequently met with was that of raising the building exposed to the ravages of this pest a few feet above the ground by means of steel uprights, to each of which was attached a metal cup completely encircling the support. These cups were filled with some noxious liquid, such as paraffin, which had the effect of entirely insulating the building. Evaporation and the formation of a film of dust frequently negatived these precautions and was the cause of permitting the ant an entrance. Further attention
was drawn to the subject and other methods investigated. The use of uprights of timber suitably treated with liquid poisonous to the ant and then creosoted proved fairly successful, but the good results from this method were proved to lie not altogether permanent.
Careful study of the habits and anatomy of the ant was then made with a view to solving the problem, and it was found that by inverting the cup already mentioned and grinding the edges to a sharp finish an impassable and permanent obstacle was offered to the white ant, the articulation of its body being of such a nature that the sharp edges rendered negotiation of the cup impossible, and with every attempt a fall to the ground was inevitable.(S. F. P.)
MONTHLY REPORTS
SADONG COLLIERY.
June.
The gross out-put produced by the mines during the month was 1,924-04 tons, 450 tons of which was consumed by our boilers and 1,474-04 tons delivered to the wharf for export.
The shipments for the month were : The Kuching Municipality ... 246-10 tons.
,, Sibu Station .. 101-00 ,,
Messrs. The Borneo Co., Ltd. ... 525-16 ,, Sarawak Steamship Co. 659-00 .,
Total shipments 1,532-06 tons.
Coal stocks at the wharf were exhausted at the end of the month.	,
The out-put from the mines in the upper seam was excellent No. 8 mine in the lower seam produced a small, but regular out-put and No. 9 mine was slightly below the average for the previous month. There are signs of barren areas and disturbances ahead of the face-line in the east-side panel workings of this mine and in the event of these indications proving to be correct, the upper west-side pillar is being prepared for stopping, as the eastern boundary limits of the old -workings, which were abandoned some thirty years ago, has been reached at this point.
The work on the new railway line made good progress and everything worked well in the mechanical department.
One Chai Ho, a Chinese field-works' contractor, disappeared on the 7th. and has not been located since. He was obviously carrying out a pre-arranged plan, as the working members of his gang had. invented a story that he had gone alone into the jungle contiguous to the bazaar to fetch rotan for repairing his earth-baskets and his non-arrival was not reported until he had made good his escape. The search was soon discontinued as his working partners agreed to pay up the balance of his advances due the Collieries.
The usual up-keep and repairing work was carried out at the wharf and we were handicapped very much in this department and more still, underground, owing to the labour shortage.
The rainfall for the month was 7'76 inches.

SIMANGGANG.
-? June.
Having visited the bouses in the Jingin and above from P. Barohs house at Nanga Delok on the 1st., next day we returned to Krangan Telaus where all the chiefs of the Ulu Ai had collected. Many longstanding disputes were settled by them in con

junction with the down-river Penghulus, and next morning an aum of all the principal Dayaks in the 2nd Division was held for the purpose of determining a settlement of the feud between the Ulu Ais and the Skrangs, Lemanaks and Layers, which has existed for so many years. The arrangement of the terms having been left solely to the Dayak chiefs, a dead-lock was reached early in the afternoon. Thereupon both points of view were referred to me; and, after consolation with the Native Officers, a settlement honourable to both sides was propounded. This was unanimously acclaimed, and thereupon a pig was killed with all duo ceremony as a pledge of the good faith of all concerned, the chiefs from the Ulu Ai and downriver exchanging tokens of good will and friendliness according to Dayak custom. Next morning, final arrangements having been completed for the official peace-making between these tribes to take place before His Highness the Rajah in August, I left for Lubok Antu, which was reached that evening. After bearing a few cases there in the morning, I left for Engkilili, where the night was spent. Some cases were heard next day, the only one of note that of the alleged poisoning of an infant by a Chinese physician. This was adjourned for advice from the Principal Medical Officer, and I then left for the Lemanak, whither the Native Officers had proceeded me to examine into a farming land dispute. I spent the evening in Penghulu Suels house, and returned to Simanggang the following day, the 7th. Mr. Dick reported that the Sabu district had been carefully watched for the escaped prisoner, and police had searched the jungle with a party of Dayaks. This however bad proved fruitless, through thefts of food-
stuffs front garden huts would seem to point to the presence of some fugitive.
A mail arriving here on the 3rd. was sent up by Tongkat but missed me on the way down-river, and was not returned here till the 9th. As this contained certain instructions from His Highness the Rajah, I left for Kuching at once by boat, arriving there on the 11th. I returned to Lingga on the 14th by s. l Alice Lorraine, arriving here next day.
Mr. Dick reported that a Chinese silversmith by name Ah Bong, who had been working here for many years, absconded by the last trip of s. I Hong Line, owing Dayaks a considerable sum of money given him in silver dollars for making belts, and a warrant had been despatched to the Police in Kuching for his arrest.
Hari Raya was observed on the 18th.
Mr. Dick accompanied by Abang Dul left for the Saribas on the 21st., visiting Betong, Spaoh and Pusa, returning here, on the 27th. He reports accounts correct by the books, but some slackness on the part of the Court writer of Pusa, which has been attended to.
Court.P. C. Ahm of Lingga was dismissed the force, and sentenced to 3 months imprisonment for gross neglect of duty and misappropriation of property left in his charge. Bala, Rejang Dayak living m the Lemanak, 2 years for incest, and Tidan (f) of Lemanak one year. Saifullah, prison mandor dismissed for abuse of his official position by demanding money from Chinese, this being the culmination of a series of complaints against him. Several Pusa Chinese were duly fined in connection with a case of assault in the bazaar, and the necessary security for future behaviour deposited. Kaw Liang who attempted to bribe the Court writer in connection with the affair, was fined $50 in addition. Ngantin, a Sabu Chinese, having been arrested on a bandong down-river en route for Miri, on a charge of theft from the local dhobi, certain property found in his possession lead to another action for theft from the H. P. G. Mission house at Sabu ; on this being duly
convicted, he was sentenced to nine months imprisonment. The first charge is adjourned pending further evidence, required from a Sabu Dayak who went to Kuching by the same boat.
The charge of attempted murder brought against Garit, Skrang Dayak, mentioned in the April report, was brought up on the 25th. and adjourned. Umba and her child have made a most remarkable recovery.
Au action against certain Stumbin Malays for adulterating sago was finally settled on the 29th., and exemplary fines imposed,
Prisoner Chong Chee, an extremely bad character, was sentenced to 3 months extra imprisonment and six strokes, for striking another Chinaman with a changkol while working on the-bazaar road.
There were several other cases, principally concerning farming lands and breach of food control regulations regarding the export of padi and rice, which do not call for special mention.
Lubok Antu.The Assistant Resident of Sintang, N. I., accompanied by the Controleur of Smitan paid a short visit to the station from Nanga Badau on the 29th.
LinggaThe s. s. Sarawak visited Lingga and Sebuyow in the early part of the month, under charter of certain Kuching towkays, with a view to investigating the local timber resources.
Saribas-A fire broke out in Liang Haks godown at Pusa on the night of the 18th., but luckily was put out by kampong Malays before much damage was done it is not known how the fire originated.

Court. There were not a great many cases before the Courtsa considerable number were trivial Dayak disputes which were referred to the Penghulus for settlement.
Chin Seng was sent to gaol for returning from banishment and Poh Hin for corresponding with a prisoner Nam Shoot who subsequently attempted to escape but was recaptured and received the usual punishment.
Sadam and Temah, the former Mr. Carpenters boy, were sent to gaol for the theft of a considerable amount of clothing and other property from Mr. Carpenter some of which was subsequently recovered.
Public Works.The already tumble down boat sheds have been entirely demolished and the rotten boats they contained sold. Only one Government boat is fit for use. The coal-shed will also be pulled down and coal stacked in the open.
The Contractor has commenced erecting the new barracks which will be completed next mouth.
A start has been made to rebuild the bazaar road and the first section has been finished and gravelled. There is a vast supply of excellent gravel at the bead of Polo Kerto and several hundred tons of this have been worked and stacked in the bazaar for the road. The bazaar shop-owners are rebuilding their gangways of bilian and of uniform size as the road is completed, and all shops are having repairs effected to the buildings where necessary.
A gang of Tamil coolies have been recruited in Kuching and these arrived here on the 20th. They
175	THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, AUGUST 2, 1920.
have raised repaired and generally cleaned up the K. Nyabor road and are now similarly engaged on the down-river kampong road. Each kampong has undertaken to regravel its own road as the repairs are completed.
It is getting increasingly difficult to obtain labour here and excessive prices are asked for building, prices that are quite absurd compared with those in other parts of the country.
The Dayaks have had a good harvest and consequently will not work timber and it is almost impossible to obtain any. The large stock of Government bilian at Kapit has unfortunately been sold elsewhereit would have been useful to have kept it here.
General.I returned from Matu and Rejang on the 6th. after settling many cases at the former place. There were still a large number awaiting settlement when I left but many of the litigants were either at Daro or elsewhere in the delta and it was not possible to collect them in the time.
Matu station was not in good order the natural result of no officer being stationed there.
The s.s. Flevo made two trips during the month the second time she was nearly prevented from sailing by a shortage of coal at Sadong where she intended to obtain bankers. However she borrowed sufficient coal from Government here to carry her to Singapore and back.
The s. s. Alice Lorraine also made two tripsthe first with much needed buffaloes which materially assisted the food supply, and the second with a cargo of coni for Government.
H. H. Y. Zahora arrived on the 12th. with the Superintendent of Telegraphs, Mr. Barnes, who, after overhauling the wireless plant returned to Kuching on the 14th. Twenty-one cases of wireless material were sent to Kuching by the return trip of the Zahora.
The s. s. Sarawak arrived from Kuching on the 24th., returning again two days later.
The 18th. being Hari Raya the Government offices were closed for the day.
The s.l. Chamois was sent to Mukah, Oya and Balingean to bring back the surplus cash at these stations and returned to Sibu on the 27th. with $45,000.
P. C. Cham Singh shot himself dead with a Winchester rifle at Sidonan on the 26th. He had been drinking heavily of late and was in a very shaky condition at the time.
Mr. Archer visited Kapit on the 28th. to hold Court returning again on the 30th.
Reports from up-river indicate the presence of numerous Dayaks on or near the border, where they have been destroying Punan property and looking for Punan heads. Penghulu Melintang has been sent up to find out the truth of these reports and to send all Dayaks back down-river.
All Dayaks have sufficient padi to last them till next harvest and many have had record crops and the general opinion is that unless padi is exported there is sufficient rice in the district to feed the whole population until the next crop is taken in.
Dayaks and Chinese are-now busy preparing their farms for the next sowing. Unfortunately a considerable area of the best padi land is under rubber which is usually planted much too close together and in many cases is being rapidly ruined by bad tapping. Thousands of trees will never be fit to tap again in a few years time and the plantations rendered valueless.
The rainfall for the month amounted to 7'07 inches. No rain fell on 20 days.

DONALD A. OWEN, Resident 3rd. Division.
OYA.
June.
Court.Chui Im and an accomplice were fined $100 each and compensation for assaulting Ah Boo and the former a further $100 tor ignoring a warning not to assault. All three were pledged upon security to keep the peace for twelve months, as continual quarrelling has been going on for some years between them, they being rival traders.
Tahip. a continual offender, was sentenced to one year R. I. for swindling five Dayaks out of their jelutong.
Wee Ah Hong, who attempted to abscond under advances, acknowledged in full his Oya debts of about $1,000 and was forwarded to Sibu for trial, where he is involved in a much larger amount.
Lo Ho, a recent inmate of Mukah gaol, was arrested and charged with the theft of over $300, the night of his arrival in Dalat. The evidence, however, was so circumstantial that the case was forwarded to the Resident 3rd. Division for judgment.
Many other cases, mostly land disputes, were also dealt with.
Seven of ten near relatives of Kalil, of Kampong Balan, who is under warrant for arrest, have been remanded in Oya gaol and the remaining three sent off to get hold of him. under penalty of fine.
They are all strongly suspected of having aided Kalil to evade arrest for over nine months, in spite of repeated endeavours to catch him by surprise.
He has been continually theiving in the meantime and threatens with his parang, anyone who attempts to capture him.
Once before he was guilty of similar behaviour.
There was one appeal in the Court of Requests, Dalat, which was dismissed by the Resident 3rd. Division.
P. W. D.On the first of the month requests for tenders were issued regarding the erection of police barracks, six doors at Oya and an extra door at Dalat.
Up to the present only one tender has been submitted and that one is unacceptable.
Although Government undertakes to provide all the materials excepting soft wood planks, rengs, nails and labour, none of the local carpenters, if they may be termed as such, appear keen on accepting a contract, except at an exhorbitant figure.
I am thus unable to submit an accurate estimate of the cost at present.
Lack of paid labour appears to be the trouble.
Prison labour, therefore, appears to be the solution and that is not plentiful.
Five extra barrels of whitewash were procured from Mukah, thus enabling the work on the unfinished buildings at Dalat to be completed.
Prisoners have been working upon the bridges, roads, ditches and Government grounds.
The telephone lines from Dalat towards Sibu and also Mukah were examined and several obstructions removed. The new Mukah line between Oya and Dalat is now in working order.

u.c. AT a time when the utility of the bicycle is becoming more and more recognised it is essentially important that care should be taken to get only a good machine. Bicycles look so much alike to the_ uninitiated that by far the best plan is to deal only through a reputable local tradesman and select a machine with known name. As instance, the Raleigh, the all-steel bicycle, could not have attained its position as by far the most popular high-grade bicycle in the world without possessing inherent good qualities, and the owner of a Raleigh knows that he or she has a machine which will, for all practical purposes, last a life-time. There is no question in the mind of all experienced cyclists that the best bicycle is always the cheapest in the end.
