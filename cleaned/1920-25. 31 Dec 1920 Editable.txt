Death of Dr. Odoardo Beccari.
All natural history lovers in Sarawak will regret to hear of the death of the great Italian naturalist Dr. Odoardo Beccari, Sc. D. F. R. M. S., C. M. Z. S etc., which took place on the 25th October 1920 at Firenze, Italy
Dr. Beccari had a world wide reputation. He will be last remembered in Sarawak by his book entitled Wanderings on the Great Forests of Borneo" being a description of his travels in Sarawak and his botanical and zoological researches.
Dr. Beccari first landed in Sarawak in June 1865 in company with his great friend and companion Giacous Doria with the object of investigating its natural history. His book however was not published till many years afterwards in 1904. He describes in the preface to his work how a happy chance lent to his meeting with Her Highness the Ranee in Florence who urged him to the task of putting together his notes.
Dr. Beccari remained in Sarawak till January 1868 with the exception of a month spent in Singapore in 1866 when Doria had to return to Europe on account of ill health. He made an expedition to the Kapuas lakes and also visited Labuan and Brunei.
A return visit was paid to Sarawak ten years later in 1877 the interval being spent in almost constant travel in New Guinea, the Moluccas, Celebes and Java as well as Abyssinia.
Dr. Beccari spent many months on Matang Mountain and he called the house which he occupied Vallombrosa. The present Rajahs bungalow occupies the old site.

THE staff of the Sarawak Farms Syndicate are kindly presenting a Silver Cup valued at $50 for a football competition open to all comers.
Teams competing must be sent in to Mr. Howell by the 14th. January 1921. All teams will be registered up to 18 players and no alterations will be allowed after the names of players have been sent in.
Entrance fee for each team $1.50. A Committee composed of the following will arrange all roles, etc., and their decision on any matter shall be final:Messrs. P. Stewart, Wee Keng Chiang, E. Howell and O. Lang.
THE following is an extract from the letter of a correspondent in the London & China Express.
The Chinese, as is well known, are, as i nation, most industrious, peace-loving and law-abiding, and thus are a great and valuable asset to the worlds wealth : and it is to the advantage of nil other nations that they should be enabled to overcome their terrible enemiesplague, pestilence and famine, and disorders forced on them by political malcontents. Apart from a few provinces, the greater part of China proper could well carry a much larger population if only improved methods of cultivation were used, and the immense mineral and other natural wealth developed, and, of course, given a strong and stable Government and proper means of communication, whilst Manchuria and a good part of Mongolia, with other unoccupied areas, could well carry another two hundred millions. Then, again, as in the Malay Slates and other parts, the Chinese would make ideal settlers for developing regions in other lands where white men" cannot live and do hard work.
It should be remembered that despite many and serious handicaps the Chinese are full of vitality, and have many traits and characteristics which have enabled them to survive, as a great nation, when other Empires have gone tinder, and they bid fair to hold on when some of the present or recently mighty Powers have decayed and gone under.
LETTERS OF CUTHBERT.
MY DEAR PERCY,
I suppose you have read "Toys" and criticised it freely over your evening stengah. I think I hear you say Fancy Serini hanging herself with Jaharee in the running, handing out the gladsome optic with both hands.
I can't make up my mind what happened to Warren, after murdering Elissa. Perhaps he got lost in the jungle and gradually deteriorated into the missing link in the epilogue or perhaps he went to Santubong for the week-end. However Percy old pea it is easier to criticise a yarn than to write it, and as there is some good stuff in it, we will leave it at that.
All kinds of shows are being prepared for Christmas and secret rehearsals are taking place every day, so we are all expecting great things on the night.
It is extraordinary how the most insignificant happenings affect the greater issues of life is not it Percival, take for instance the case put forward by our local pessimists the other day. It appears we just escaped a revolution not long ago, owing to a squabble between three Chinese Generals who were undergoing the open air treatment outside the walls of Pekin. It seems that General Ping Pong accused General Bak Sze of opening a Jack Pot" without any openers and handed him a lemon. Hence the famine in China. But dont be surprised to hear that Bak Sze failing to get away with his

The Stamps of Sarawak.
A new hand-book on the stamps of Sarawak has recently been published al the Offices of Stamp Collecting" 89 Farringdon Street, London, entitled A Study of the Stamps of Sarawak by Major B. H. D. Lockhart, F. R., P. S. L.
This little book is very comprehensive and gives in derail the flaws on all the panes of the early lithographed stamps.
In describing the Perkins-Bacon issue of 1895 the author throws some new light on the proofs and colour trials which have been found surcharged with a new value in pence Mr. Melville in his book on page 58 says that, it is evident that at one time there was a proposal to change the currency into pence. The author made enquiries and found this to be erroneous. Presumably the printers after printing the Sarawak Stamps were producing the British South African Stamps which have figures in each coiner and pence at the bottom.
These were to be printed on a sheet about the same size as the Sarawak Stamps and to test the stretch of the paper with a view to registration of the two colours, some spoilt sheets of the Sarawak Sin tops were taken and overprinted.
On the 10th. instant at 10 a. m. 27 coolies arrived from the Siniawan district supposed to be the first batch of several hundreds. They were given one day's ration, one of their number was chosen by themselves to act as cook; and they were told that they would lie expected io turn out to work at 1 p.m. At about 12 o'clock to my surprise I saw all these men with their mats going down to the pangkalan, I immediately followed them and ordered them to return to their quarters, when I would report any grievances they had to the Resident. As they refused to commence work, I took 5 of them over to see the Resident, they stated to him that they were rubber tappers and did not know how to do any other kind of work, and that in consequence the work offered was far too hard. On being asked what they would do now that no one was lapping rubber, they had no reply, but persisted that they did not want manual labour. They were then told, they could either take this work or go back to Siniawan. Nineteen of them went back. The rest elected to stay.
Up to date 88 men have asked for letters from the Police Court Magistrate entitling them to Government assistance. 23 of these did not even take the trouble to bring the letters over to me. Some of them worked a few days and then left.
My experience with these men has convinced me that the statement made that hundreds of coolies are starving through being unable to obtain work is absolutely untrue. The majority of those who have taken advantage of the Government's offer are ex-criminals and bazaar loafers, who have never done a day's work in their lives, and do not intend to if they can possibly avoid it. Their haste to return to the bazaar when the hour for work commences being a very good proof of this.
Yours faithfully,
S. CUNYNGHAME, CAPT.

KUCHING, SARAWAK,
20th. December, 1920.
The Editor,
Sarawak Gazette,
Kuching.
SIR,	,
As there has been a good deal of wild talking lately about the supposedly hundreds of unemployed Chinese coolies said to be starving, the following facts as to what the Government has done in the matter may lie of interest.
On the 6th. instant I was asked by the Resident, if I could arrange to lake up to 50 Chinese unemployed coolies to work at levelling up the parade ground at the Fort. 1 agreed to do so. It had been stated that unemployment was very prevalent owing to most of the rubber garden owners discharging their employees and that many of these men were now starving. The Government wishing to help them made the following offer. Free quarters, free allowance of rations, and cash 16 cents per day, in return for their labour. The coolies to be free to leave at any time they could procure more lucrative work.
The following day these men began to come in by one's and twos as the news of the Governments offer spread throughout the district. It was rather a shock to me to find that these men were not in the condition I had anticipated, as several of them wished to arrange the kind of work they should do, saying that they were rubber tappers, so should not be expected to know how to use changkols and that they could carry on quite well without having to do work of that kind. Some of these men came and looked at the work and left hurriedly having in their haste no doubt forgotten, that on their arrival they had been given a days ration in advance, and that therefore they should do one days work in payment.

November.
The gross out-put for the month was 2,086.12 tons, 450 tons of this was consumed by our boilers and 1,636.12 tons delivered to the wharf.
The shipments for the month were as under: -
The Kuching Municipality	...	309.08 tons.
,, Sibu (Government) Station ... 103.00 ,,
Messrs. The Borneo Company, Ltd. ... 642.05 ,.
..	.. Sarawak Steamship Co. ... 747.15 ..
Soon Seng & Co. ... ...	210.00 .,
Total shipments 2,012,08 tons.
Stocks of coal on the wharf at the end of the month amounted to 934.19 tons.
Export figures for the month were good. The s. s. Gladys made one trip to Singapore with a cargo of coal consigned to the owners of the vessel for their own consumption.
The mines in both seams produced a fair average out-put and work on the side-walls for the entrance arch at one of the new mines was commenced.
A small quantity of timber has been prepared for the Engineers bungalow and most of the posts, which are sudunsor, have been brought in, and the concrete bases made for these in the ground-floor are nearly completed.
The padi crop planted on the jungle side of the Ngili stream is gradually withering away. An attempt is being made to save as much as possible by having what is left of it removed to the irrigated land situated on the opposite side of the stream.

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, DECEMBER 31, 1920.
The hill padi is looking excellent, and a small area still remains to be planted.
The new Ngili stream which has been dug out in order to drain the flat land contiguous to the collieries has struck the natural stream at a point 6,000 feet below the colliery bazaar, and rather less than half that distance above the entrance to the Simunjan river, so that the drainage system at the collieries is now completed.
The labour force was increased by seventeen (17) Chinese coolies and two (2) Tamils, recruited in, and around Kuching during the month.
There was a good deal of sickness amongst the employees and the staff. The Medical Officer paid a short visit here early in the month.
A good quantity of shale was dumped on the swampy ground behind the bazaar, and the road to the wharf was repaired for half the distance.
The havoc made to the wharf and river-bank by the high tides during the month was considerable.
The rainfall for the month was 765 inches.

BINTULU.
November.
Court.A case of breach of promise was brought up from the Native Court, whose decision was upheld. The defendant, however, was dissatisfied and was allowed an appeal to a Superior Court. Few other cares were heard.
P. W. D.The principal work undertaken by the prisoners was the clearing of the inland road to Kidurong Point. This is much used at this time of year by those seeking a passage by the p. s. Adeh and also by the mail-carriers.
Tubau. I visited Tubau and up-river stations, accompanied by Datu Haji Abdullah, from 21st. 28th. of the month. Heavy rain fell all the time 1 was away and all low-lying ground was under water. Tubau, where the Court house is built on a hill, was the only station where dry land was found. I do not think that the water will lie long enough to spoil the padi.
The clerks house at Pandan is now almost completed, the walls of the kitchen and the veranda rails only remain to be done. These will be finished when the carpenter has recovered from an attack of fever. The walls of the house are of bark in twelve feet strips and will last, I understand, as long as soft wood planks.
At Pandan I sold 200 passus of Government padi to Punans, Penans and Dayaks whose harvest had failed. I also offered 100 passus to the Kayans in exchange for timber, but they were unwilling to accept Hila, (T. K. Pandan) reported that 17 tapang trees of his had been destroyed by Dayaks of Rirang's house while making their farms. The case was adjourned for an inspection to lie made and will be heard at Bintulu. Kadop (son of Tama Jaw, Punan Tua Kampong) was convicted of theft and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Several deputations asked that this might be commuted for a money payment, stating that it was not the custom of the Government to imprison Punans for theft, as, being an uncivilised race, they knew no better. They also referred me to an alleged precedent which had occurred some eleven years before. On returning to this station I looked up the case and found that part of a sentence passed on a Kayan for theft had been remitted, but on account of his old age and infirmities I imagine that if the culprit in the recent case had been of humble
November.
Only two cases of importance came before the Court for hearing Tubam fined $150 for abduction and Ah Koh of Chop Hong Hin $200 for swindling.
Fines and fees amounted to $751.
Hun Ajang son of Penghulu Aban Jan arrived on 5th. instant and reported that the Kalabit expedition was returning.
Messrs. Crocker and Harrison Smith being at Loug Akar awaiting Major Moulton who has fever and is coming down the Akar.
Sent the launch to Long Palai to meet them they arriving here on 9th. instant.
Messrs. Crocker and Moulton left via Miri on the 15th. instant.
Imbi Tuai of Ridan returned from Bakong having failed to find laud. He wishes to move and reports the laud at Ridan is not good.
Penghulu Lanting paid a visit to Belait to fetch some relations.
Rainfall was 6'16 inches.

birth no great efforts would have made to obtain his release. Ah Yok, agent for the opium farm, was charged with selling opium at a price above that sanctioned by Government, sentence was deferred. Jarah (T. K. Labang) was lined for not reporting Dayaks farming on his land without Government permission and a pledge was taken from the latter to ensure their removal after harvest.
While at Tubau I agreed to purchase direct from Kayans two laksa of attaps at $90 per laksa. to Ire delivered at Bintulu within three months.
General.The cow-herd, Nanda Singh, who has occupied this position for sixteen years was discharged for negligence. Under his care the Government herd was rapidly disappearing.
Some building land in one of the kamgongs was inspected and the sago-palms thereon valued at $39 the land can now be cleared and built on.
P. S. Adeh dropped mails at Kidurong Point on the 13th. and 25th. on her way north. The m. t. Miri entered twice and cleared, on the second occasion, with a lighter-load of timber.
An application for further farming land has been made by Pu. Merdan across the boundary (S. Binai) laid down some years ago. Several protests have been made to me about the matter, and, at present, the request has been refused, though it will come forward again. The Dayaks in this river have exhausted all the best farming land in their boundaries and are now looking enviously at the almost untouched land of their neighbours.
During the month the Malay school was inspected and prizes given to the more deserving scholars. The standard maintained is not high, but all the boys are taught to read and write their own language. The attendance is not altogether regular; an average. of 45 boys out of 65 attended daily.
The price of the sugar during the month was lowered to 45 cents per kati and though this is some relief it does not appear in proportion to the reported drop in price. Cloth still sells at the old high figure and will remain so until the shop-keepers have exhausted their old stocks.
Rainfall for the month amounted to 1708 inches.

Out-put. The gross out-put of coal was 2.570 tons, 772.50 tons of which was consumed by our boilers and the balance 1,797.50 tons sent to wharf.
Exports.The export of coal amounted to 2.213 tons as follows:
Per lighters to Labuan ...	1,205 tons
., s. s Euzkadi to Manila	1,008 ,,
Bunker Sales.The following steamers and launches were supplied with hunkers : S. S. Euzkadi ...	... 30 tons

Total	682 tons
Coal left in stock on November 30th. was 57.75 tons only.
Sales at Labuan amounted to 956 tons, making total sales for Labuan and Brooketon 2,596 tons.
Everything went smoothly in all under-ground and mechanical departments. The old vertical Downcast Shaft which had been sealed off about two and a half years ago, caved in after the recent heavy rains. This shaft was 158 feet in depth and only 58 feet away from our range of boilers at the surface, consequently there was a great anxiety felt for the safety of the boilers, but a large gang of coolies were got to work and we had the shaft completely filled in in a couple of days. After this experience it was decided to have the old Upcast Shaft filled in also, as this also showed signs of collapsing in the near future.
The s. l. Lucile was kept very busy towing coal over to Labuan throughout the month, with the exception of two days which was spent on cleaning her boiler and overhauling her engine. One of the lighters was beached for repairs.
The rainfall at Brooketon Mines was 12'31 inches.

LIMBANG.
November.
Court.The number of cases this month was below the average, the majority being of a trivial nature. For illicitly receiving goods in pawn Chu Lee was fined $25. The case of Ah Kee vs: Nio Joo, creating a disturbance in plaintiffs house, was adjourned until I next visit Danau.
General.On the 5th. I left with Mr. MacBryan for Danau, proceeding on the 7th. to the upper Limbang. The water being favourable the Damit was able to pass over the rocks and batangs opposite the entrance to Sungei Medamit, and reach Karuts bouse, just below the gravel beds. This by the way is the farthest the launch has ever been. Here I left Mr. Mac Bryan to visit as far as Medalam, and to check the tax book from there down to the Inst Bisayah kampong. I got back to Limbang on the 8th.
Mr MacBryan returned on the 13th. and reported there was little tax outstanding, and those who had riot paid had some legitimate excuse. He found the Medalam people in a very bad way, they having had a succession of bad harvests, of which the last would appear to have been the worst. The Murut kampongs of Kerangan Kramit and Baking Tulit have entirely disappeared, the inhabitants of the former removing to Laut Batu Ajong at Tubai, half an hours walk from the river, a Dayak house of eleven doors under one Nyambong hits recently been built, and appears to be the centre of any kampar Dayaks who may be passing through.
I visited Limpaku Penang on the morning of the 17th. the padi here was not looking very flourishing, but in other parts of the district the harvest prospects would appear to be good. The floods early in the month did a certain amount of damage to some of the farms fringing the river banks. I was away from the; 19th. to the 27th. visiting Sundar, Tutsan, Lawas and Brooketon. At Sundar I met the Officer-in-Charge and accompanied him to Trusan and Lawas, walking to and from the latter place.
The Damit returned from Brooketon on the 2nd. where she had been in dock for the last three weeks, having a new bush and propeller shaft fitted, also a general overhauling of her engines. The colliery fitters have made an excellent job of her, and she is running splendidly. Break downs are very rare, which fact goes to prove that her present caretaker is more satisfactory than the last.
Mr. Doherty, of the Island Trading Co., Brunei, called in on the 13th. on business, he was accompanied by Inspector Manu.
The p. s. Adeh made three, and the m. l. Adele four trips this month. One hundred and sixteen head of buffaloes were exported to Kuching.
Exports amounted to $22,068 and imports to $21,536.
The total rainfall registered 18'09 inches.

Court.Fines and feesLawas $98.58. Trusan $316.28.
A good many cases came before the Courts principally at Trusan and Sundar. The chief of which were: Chow Chong six months imprisonment for theft. Chow Hin punished for wife beating. Ngilo Lun (Murut) fined $25 for assault on Ilo Merak who was also fined $5 for provoking same. Bakar bin Tuah and Ajak both from Brunei were fined $50 and $30 respectively for smuggling. Padun Lasong sentenced to six months imprisonment and deprived of his gun for threatening to shoot another Murut under provocation. A complaint was also brought by a Chinese against Lance Corp. Sewa Singh that he was in the habit of accepting bribes. This was investigated by the District Officer-in-Charge, Limbang and not proved but Sewa Singhs answers were not considered satisfactory and he was warned.
General.Prisoners were engaged during the month on roads and gardens and the fortmen mowing. Prisoners averaged 16 men. A lamp-post was erected in the Lawas bazaar the Government providing the lamp and the Chinese engaging to supply the oil and pay for the up-keep they also agreed to pay the wages of a dustman and lamp-lighter who was

duly engaged. A ferry was instituted across the river at Lawas and Ludin appointed ferryman. Two run-a-way Javanese coolies were arrested and banded over to the Brunei Government and two more at present undergoing sentences in Lawas gaol will be handed over on completion of sentence. The clerk at Sundar has been told by the Medical Officer that his leg must be amputated, as this distract is very badly off for clerks this will mean more extra work for the Trusan clerk. At Merapok a notice was put up that anyone wishing to go over the border into B. N. Borneo must take out a pass this is necessary in order to try and check the smuggling there. Smuggling is very difficult to check in this district owing to the lack of the necessary machinery, two good customs clerks would make a great difference.
Movements.I was at Merapok on November 1st. 2nd. and at Trusan from November 4th.11th. and again from November 14th.23rd. on which occasion I met the District Officer-in-Charge and Mrs Boult at Sundar on the 19th. and accompanied them to Trusan on the 21st. and on the 23rd. walked over with the District Officer to Lawas be returning to Trusan on the 25th. and leaving the same day with Mrs. Boult on his return to Limbang.
I proceeded to Labuan on the evening of the 25th. on m. l. Nancy with Mr. G. M. Allman taking with me two sick prisoners one of whom died on arrival. I there met the Medical Officer and discussed medical matters returning on the 27th. to Lawas. The Treasury clerk, Lawas was away November 1st. and 2nd. and 29th. and 30th. checking accounts at Merapok and the mouth of the Lawas and the clerk at Trusan on the 16th.18th. and 29th.30th. checking accounts at Sundar.

WE beg to announce that we have recently been appointed Sole Agents in Sarawak, Brunei and British North Borneo for Messrs. Joseph Travers & Sons, Limited, proprietors of the well-known SHIP and SIGNAL brands of TINNED PROVISIONS and are now ready to commence business on Wholesale lines.
It is still impossible to obtain adequate supplies from England and the Colonies but the situation becomes easier week by week and we hope shortly to be able to meet all demands.
We shall be pleased to send price lists on application.
