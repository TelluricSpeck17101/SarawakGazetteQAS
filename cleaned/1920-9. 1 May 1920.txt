Diocese of Labuan and Sarawak.
Ordination of Deacons.
?
(Contributed.)
On the Eeast of S. Mark. (April 25th), in S. Thomas Pro-Cathedral, the Bishop of the Diocese, admitted two candidates E. G. Proctor and Si Migaat to the Holy Order of Deacons.
The Ordination took place al the choral Eucharist, at 6.45 a.m., the clergy present being the Bishop, Rev. F. S. Hollis and Rev. Kong Kwui En.
The service began with a sermon preached by Rev. F. S. Hollis, who also presented the candidates to the Bishop in the absence of the Archdeacon. A Litany was sang, and the Eucharist proceeded as usual as far as the Epistle.
Then the Bishop seated in his chair before the altar, and attended by crucifer and servers, examined the two candidates by asking them the questions in the Prayer Book, and afterwards laid on hands, saying the words of Ordination, and delivering to each a copy of the New Testament. The Rev. F. S. Hollis then placed the stoles on the new Deacons, who took their appointed places in the sanctuary, and the Rev. E. G. Proctor read the Gospel.
Both the new Deacons assisted at the administration of the Blessed Sacrament, when 72 persons made their communion.
The service over, the Bishop handed to each of the Deacons, his Letters of Orders and his Licence, which gives authority to officiate in the Diocese.
The Rev. E. G. Proctor is a Tamil from Jaffna, Ceylon, and his people have been Christians for several generations. He entered business in the F. M. S. some years ago, being confidential clerk and typist to a business house in Klang. When he offered himself for Ordination, he was sent to Barisal, the training college of the Oxford Mission to Calcutta, and remained there for two years, passing all his examinations with credit. On his return to the F. M. S., he worked for a short time as catechist in the Diocese of Singapore, and then came to Sarawak as Tamil Catechist in November 1919. Besides ministering to a small congregation of Christian
Tamils, and conducting a school for Tamil children,
he also assists in the teaching of S. Thomas School. He is a good English speaker.
The Rev Si'Migaat is a Land Dayak from Quop, and is the first Dayak to receive Holy Orders. He was educated at S. Thomas School, and afterwards joined the staff of the Diocese first as Reader, and then Catechist. He has served faithfully for 15 years, chiefly in Kuching. He now returns to minister to his own people in Quop, and to assist the venerable priest, Rev. Chung Ah Luk.

UPPER SARAWAK.
BAU AND PAKU.
March.
Court.Bong Lee was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for theft of a large number of tapping cups at Buso, and Tasmin for stealing zinc latex chutes at Dahan. Chong Jit was sent to gaol for stealing, Liew Jim and Tsai Thiam for stealing rubber, and four Malay boatmen for breach of contract with the Sarawak Rubber Estates, Ltd. Dahan.
Sam Jun was lined $25 and $13 costs for trading at Pengkallan Ampat contrary to Government orders. Supaya $25 for adulterating the milk supply, and two Javanese women and two Hylam boys on Dahan Estates $44.28 each for adultery, while one of the latter was fined another $15 for trespass in Mr Ewarts bungalow.
There were several other cases of assault, etc., but none of any importance.
Public Works.The prison gang completed the levelling of the site for the barracks, built a new kerosine oil store on a new site, and were engaged in the usual up-keep of roads and grounds. A great deal of their time was taken up in transporting the rice supply from the store to the Government shop in the bazaar as it was required.
The bilian bridge over S. Kradam below Siniawan has been completed by the P. W. D., Kuching. The erection is well and strongly built, and much more suitable for this road than the majority of the old bridges on it.
The clerks new house is under construction and will lie completed next month. A contract has been made for the erection of the new barracks with kitchen, and these will be put in hand as soon as sufficient timber is available.
General -I went to Kuching on the 6th. returning on the 9th.
An accident occurred at the Works early in the month, the seven year old child of one of the fitters falling into one of the filter tanks, when it was not in use.The disturbance in the water was noticed and the child was pulled out, but life was extinct.
Even had the accident been noticed earlier, the quantity of cyanide in the solution would probably have ensured the childs death. It had no right to be on the premises at all.
On the night of the 16th. a gardener's house at Seringgok was held up by two Chinese armed with thorny sticks, while two more proceeded to the piggery, and cut up and made off with a pig weighing some 90 catties. The gardener got out through the back of the house and raised the alarm, but the thieves managed to make good their escape in the darkness.
A similar attempt was made on a piggery in Tondong on the 27th., but the thieves were disturbed, and failed to get away with the pigs, though they left two so badly cut about that they had to be killed.
Two men were caught at Siniawan trying to sell 55 catties of rubber to a licensed dealer. Suspicions were aroused and the two men were arrested. It appeared that the rubber had been stolen from a Chinese house at Tondong the same morning. One of the thieves was an escaped prisoner from Kuching gaol, named Liew Chow, alias Liew Joon ; and the other a recently released prisoner (an old thief) from Bau gaol.
The milk supply was tested during the month and found to be adulterated with 30% of added water. The Tamil cowman was fined $25 in consequence.
$8000 were sent to Kuching Treasury.
Applications for land for padi planting continue to
come in from Malay and Chinese.
None of them need any urging to plant this year, but they wish to be allowed to sell the resultant crop at the market price of rice current at the time.
Rice distribution continues. During the month 222 bags of rice were sold from the Government shop at 90 cents per gantang.
An extra clerk was engaged during the month to help in the Food Control Office temporarily.
Prices are still rising and foodstuffs of any kind are difficult to obtain. Wages are consequently going up and Dayak tappers can now command as much as $25 a month, where they formerly received $10 to $12.
Owing to the Dayaks being busy with the harvest,
labour on the robber gardens is scarce, and in some cases tapping has entirely ceased.
The rainfall for the month amounted to 1314 inches.
The out-put from the Cyaniding Works amounted
to gold 1,209.2 ozs. and silver 262.4 ozs.

March.
On the 1st. I returned from Betong, leaving Mr. J. A. H. Hardie behind in order to visit Debak and Pusa.
For the time of year the Court was kept busy : numerous jelutong road disputes were settled. Ladis was fined $22.14 for drawing his sword and threatening one Drahman. Koo Thit was fined $25 for assaulting one Goh Ah Ka, Chiew Kui Thiam was imprisoned for six months for assault with a weapon. Chiang Chisp and Lim Fook Siew silver-smiths were fined $25 each for breach of trust. Ucham, a Dayak, was sentenced to six months imprisonment for theft. Ah Bah was sent to gaol for three months for living amongst Dayaks, Lemudin three months for assault and Abang and Mohamat fined $50 each for assisting Lemudin. Bujang one year for theft.
On 9th. Mr. W. F. Dick returned from Kuching.

It was clearly proved that Ran tai was deliberately attempting to reopen a longstanding decision of the Court, and his deposit was forfeited. In these days of prosperity amongst Saribas Dayaks a severe penalty is necessary to stop such litigation, and it is hoped this will have a salutary effect. As it seemed that Rantai, however, though not only his house did have some cause for complaint of the small amount of farming land belonging to his house, he was granted permission to farm every alternate year on the newly formed Government land at Tanjong Bemban. Ujai of Sempadi was lined a pikul for slander on Isek and Baki in connection with his land dispute with Buaw. On an appeal from Mendong (f), and after examination by Draup, P. Tait's decision was reversed in her case with Nyanggai of Anyot. Nara, Betong Malay, was fined $50 for perjury after having sworn to his evidence in the mosque in a former case. Three Spaoh Malay youths Bukitan, Boto and Koteng were sentenced to terms of imprisonment for house breaking and theft from a Chinaman's shop at Spaoh. A lot of petty thieving has been reported lately from this place. Suleiman of Stambak being reported to have died lately, the property to the value of $500, deposited for his good behaviour after release from imprisonment in connection with Ujeh's affair in 1916, was returned to his relatives. I had another hundred odd applications from Dayaks for permits to plant, the majority being for virgin jungle. Permission was given for two more shops to be erected at Spaoh. There were good reports of the padi harvest throughout the Saribas, especially in the ulu Layer, Padih and Paku, but the Rimbas crop, I fear, is a comparative failure.
Arrangements were made to have all the newly formed lands in the main Saribas river marked off with bilian boundary posts. These will be ready for farming next year, and there were numerous applications for same. They will be given for a year
at a time to those who are really short of farming land.
On the 19th. the Chinese shop-keepers and pepper
gardeners were called up to the fort, and told that they all had to farm this year: they said that they were all willing to do so, and they were then informed that suitable land will be measured out for them by Government.
Choo Hong Tak proceeded to Betong on the 29th. to take over from Court Writer Lagan who has been
granted 6 weeks leave.
Abang Zin, Native Officer, Lubok Antu, reports that Ulu Ai Dayaks are busy harvesting, and that the crop is an exceptionally good one.
Kalaka:The Kabong Malays are obtaining large hauls of prawns, getting as much as three sacks of dry prawns in a day.
The Roban pepper gardeners report, that the new pepper is being destroyed by a certain insect, and in consequence the crop will not he good this year. A Malay farming but was burnt to the ground by
carelessness of the owner; he lost all his property and his padi. A Dayak of Sebetan also had his farm hut burnt to the ground by his own neglect, and lost 50 pasus of padi.

F. A. W. PAGE-TURNER.
Resident.
On 13th. the m. l. Sri Danuti arrived from Kuching for Sabu with the Right Rev, Bishop Danson and Mrs Danson on board, returning again on the 16th.
Mr. J. A. H. Hardie returned from the Saribas on the 14th. I herewith append his report:
Abang Dal with Abang Embit of Spaoh and P. Luta of ulu Paku examined into the complaint of the Spaoh Malays and lower Paku Dayaks against the ulu Paku Dayaks felling jungle near them for sago gardens. This was mentioned in last month's report. Having gone over all the land concerned, and made sketch maps thereof, Abang Dul returned on the 2nd, and next day Regulations were laid down in Court, the Spaoh Malays being allowed three months time to fell the jungle behind the kampong and Dayaks of Luban and Boleng a similar period to extend their present clearings between these streams. After that time, they cannot restrain others from felling there. The names of all, who wished to restrain the ulu Paku Dayaks from felling this jungle, were taken ; and, should they themselves not have done any clearing in the above period, fines will be imposed.
It is only because of certain peculiar features in this case that any extension of time was granted at all; and it is hoped that this procedure will encourage opening up of jungle and discourage the lazier native from claiming fictitious rights over such. Some two hundred applications for permits to plant sago were received. None of the other numerous cases disposed of call for special mention.
Abang Serdin, reported to be the wealthiest Malay in the Saribas. registered a will, whereby he disinherits one of his three daughters and leaves his property equally between his son and the other two daughters. I left for Spaoh in the afternoon of the 3rd, and after spending the evening there, left for the ulu Paku at 1 a. m., reaching P. Luta's house at Nanga Samu about 7.30 a. m.. As it was then raining, we stayed the day there. The Dayak para rubber plantations are particularly well looked after here. I was informed a number of Dayaks are making as much as $15 a day from their plantations. We left next morning at 8.30 a. m., in heavy rain. overland for the Rimbas. The road taken is one apparently very little used, and was much overgrown. but there was only one steep hill.
Itang's house, ulu Metong was reached at 12 and we later proceeded by boat to Debak, where we arrived at 3.30 p. m. P. Sujang and Abang Udin had nothing report. Crowds of Dayaks and Malays were down, mostly with applications to open up jungle for plantations and over one hundred and fifty permits were granted. A large number of cases were heard on the 6th. and 7th. Ngelambong and four others were severely fined for libelling P. Sujang. Sam Malay, of Debak. was sentenced to four months for theft.
Cattle owners in the Rimbas were given final warning to follow the Regulations regarding the proper fencing and attention to their herds; numerous complaints having been received from the owners of gardens of damage done by straying beasts. Abang Udin deserves credit for having got the kampong road in such good order. I left for Pusa on the 8th, and spent next day there. Arrangements were made for the clearing of the Government coconut plantation round the Court house. There were no case of importance and I left for Betong at 2 am. on the 10th. Next day, with all the Native Officers and Penghulus of the Saribas, I proceeded to Pedanom in the Padin, to examine the land in dispute there between Rantui and Naong. The former had placed a deposit of $100 in Court, as it was alleged by the latter that he had gone over a boundary laid down by the late Mr. Bailey in 1907.

March.
His Highness the Rajah arrived by H.H.S.Y Zahora, on the 20th. accompanied by Mr. G. M. Gifford.
His Highness met the principal Malays and Chinese on the 22nd, when a few matters were brought to His Highness notice ; the principal items being the shortage of bazaar accommodation and the subsidiary coinage shortage.
Mr. H. D. Aplin visited Kapit and the up-river stations from the 12th. to the 16th. While at Kapit, Mr. Aplin held an enquiry as to the cause of the death of Tama Lassah, who was alleged to have been killed by a Dayak, named Baring. It was conclusively proved that Tama l.assah was accidentally drowned. A Dayak named Muli, who had started the report that Tama Lassah had been murdered, will be duly punished.
A Naman Dayak, named Mung, was accidentally drowned on the 13th. He and a friend were going on a visit to a house on the main river and were caught in a squall, which capsized their boat. The body of Mang was recovered few days later.
Tegalan, a Segalang, found his wife alone at night, in a farm hut with a man named Julan : he attacked Julau with a parang and inflicted severe wounds on head and arm. Tegalan was charged with having committed a murderous assault and was acquitted. Julan and the woman were fined in accordance with customs.
A Foo Chow prisoner, named Tung Lee Teh, escaped from the gang on the 15th, and has not as yet been recaptured.
Mr. W.R. T. Clement returned from the Lower Rejang about the middle of the month, having settled all outstanding affairs
Mr. G. M. Gifford returned to Kapit on the 24th.
There have been few cases before the Court during the month, as the Malays and Dayaks have been busy harvesting. The former have nearly completed their harvest, but it is expected the latter will not have finished for yet another month. The harvest reports from all parts of the district are very good, with the exception of one or two Dayak houses in the Igan.
A small consignment of rice was brought by the s. s. Flevo, early in the month, but very small quantities were disposed of at the new rate of $1.60 per gantang.
From the 11th. to the 18th. imported rice was sold in accordance with the rates fixed in Notification No. XVII, and there was a rush of Chinese planters to purchase at the cheaper rate, so much so, that by the end of the week it was found that the Government had sustained a loss of $3,468. The sale at the cheaper rate was then stopped, except to the poor, with the result that up to the end of the month there were no poor registered and practically no sale of rice at the higher rate.
Twenty-four shop house lots were sold by public auction on the 24th, and realized the sum of $13,929.
A small consignment of illipe nuts was exported. It is not expected that any great quantity of these nuts will be placed on the market, as the natives will not stop work on their padi farms to collect the nuts.
Some 300 piculs of damar daging was brought down from Beluga. If the price of this resin continues high, large quantities will probably be collected by the Kayans and other people in the interior.
Other products exported continue to be above last year's monthly average. The principal items being,
vis: jelutong 2,629 piculs, sago flour 1,736 piculs and para rubber 151,701 ths.
There has been a great exodus of Foo Chow coolies during the month. The high rate of exchange in China has of late rendered it impossible for the coolie class to remit money for their families. No immigrants arrived.
The s.s. Rajah of Sarawak made one trip to and from Singapore and the s.s. Gladys one trip also.
The s.s. Flevo made the usual two trips to and from Singapore during the month.
The trade returns for the past month show the following figures, viz: Imports.

February.
At the begining of the month the new Gambling Regulations came into operation. The gambling farmer, although his contract does not expire until the end of the year, at once agreed to his rent being raised as from the 1st. February. I consider, that under the new regulations, the farm, when sold next year, should pay at least 10 times the rent that has been paid hitherto.
The sum of $50,000 in dollar notes was remitted
from Sibu Treasury, and was received at Mukah on the 3rd. The sum of $25,500 was paid out to Chinese traders during the month.
Owing to the number of thefts that have lately been committed in the bazaar, the Chinese requested
that steps should be taken to deal with a number of unemployed. These men are now working on the roads on pay of 40 cents per diem, and are kept under strict supervision. Since this arrangement has been made the thefts have stopped. All the men are opium smokers and gamblers and are really unemployable, though most of them professed to be water carriers.
All the schooners held up in the river have cleared during the month. The Sri Sandakan got as far as the month of the Matu river, and was grounded on Pasir Duablas, where she went to pieces. Her cargo consisted of raw sago, jelutong and some jangkar. It is hoped that a large part of the cargo will be salved. The first schooner of the year entered on
the 19th. February.
A circular has been sent to all Tua Kampong, and
they have been instructed to encourage their people
to plant rice substitutes on a larger scale than they have before.
On the 20th. and 24th. the Government offices were closed.
Dato Haji Azahari returned from short leave in Kuching by s.l. Chamois on the 21st. instant.
The Honble. Divisional Resident, accompanied by Mr. J. B. Archer arrived from Bintulu on the 26th.
and landed in the barong, the sea being too high for
the launch to enter the river.
On the 28th. appeal Court was bold, there being one case only for hearing. On the following day I left for Oya by the launch.

At the end of the month the Dayaks were still getting in their padi, and I understand that the crop will be an exceptionally good one. The Milanoes had a fairly good crop.
The price of raw sago has shown a slight drop at the end of the month standing at about $2.50 per passu.
March.
I returned from Oya on foot on the morning of the 3rd.
Dato Udin returned from up-river on the 16th. and reported that the Dayaks were still harvesting, and that the padi crop was an excellent one. As regards the chance of Government being able to buy up the surplus padi, I do not think there is much prospect of the Dayaks selling until later on in the year, probably not until after the farms have been burned off, and the promise of a good crop this year assured. Such Dayaks as are selling, or are willing to sell, are asking $2 per passu. The Dayaks and Chinese have been warned that trading in padi will not be permitted. I am. however, allowing the natives to procure a certain quantity of new rice and padi under certain restrictions. A quantity of Dayak rice procured by Chinese hawkers before the promulgation of the above order has been taken over by Government.
The regulations governing the sale of rice have, with the consent of His Highness, been altered, and persons wishing to purchase rice from Government at a reduced price have now to make personal application to a Committee on the score of poverty. I may mention that not a single application has been received since this alteration has been made.
The usual opening of the mouth of the river for the fine monsoon was observed by a number of natives on the 14th. of the month.
The Tua Kampong of Balingian arrived on the 15th. bringing under arrest two Chinese guilty of an affray with weapons. One man was dismissed after a preliminary enquiry, while the other was put on remand. The latter man, who was in a very weak state from fever, died a few days later while under medical treatment.
A new signalling staff was erected at the mouth of the river to replace the old staff. The new staff is of bilian.
At the end of the month the Government coconut garden was leased to a native for a period of twelve months at an increased rental of $9 per mensem.
The whole of the exemption tax for the year was paid in during the month. There are practically no defaulters this year.	Cash was paid out to Chinese traders during the month on wireless applications to the amount of $11,000.
A large junk, which tried to enter the river on the 27th. went ashore on the bar, and was firmly fixed there for some hours.
She was eventually got off after losing an anchor and cable.
The price of sago remained fairly steady with a slight tendency to drop towards the end of the month.
The principal exports for the month, exclusive of Balingian figures are as below:
1920.	1919
Raw sago	103 koyans	402	koyans
Jelutong	1,480 piculs	3,045	piculs
Jangkar 3 ,,	15 ,,
The large decrease in volume of exports is not due to any shortage of produce, but to the heavy seas still running until the middle of the month, and later on to the shallowness of the bar, which has silted up during the N. E. monsoon.

BARAM.
March.
Seman ami Raisah (f) were before the Court for incest but the case was adjourned for further evidence. The distiller and clerk of arrack farm were twice summoned for brawling; it ended in the former being imprisoned for two months, and the latter fined $15 for adulteration of arrack. Gait a Rejang Dayak was imprisoned for disobedience of Government orders and ordered to return to his country.
Fines and fees amounted to $1,855.14.

Tuanku Drahman, Native Officer returned from the Tinjar on the 17th. instant, and paid the sum of $1,212 into Treasury. He also collected over $800 for Memorial Fund.
He reports all quiet in this river. The people have not got very much padi, but have plenty of substitutes. The enkabang crop is a failure.
The Kayans under Penghulu Abun Wan as far is Bawang Takun, paid in their tax in padi, amounting to over 1,300 pasus, and over $400 for Memorial Fund.

Sin Jun and Kong Sam, prisoners, escaped on the 14th. instant. The former gave himself upon the 19th. instant. The bitter is still at large, but from information received, is still in the district and I hope be will be captured soon.
S. S. Gladys arrived on 29th. instant, having been five days outside the mouth.
At beginning of month the Chinese shipped a large consignment of damar, para rubber and jelutong direct to Singapore via Miri; over $13,000 being collected in duty.

BROOKETON COLLIERY.
March.
The gross out-put of coal amounted to 2,371-05 tons: 459 tons of which were consumed by our boilers and the balance 1,912-05 tons sent to wharf.
We shipped to Labuan 574 tons ; 358 tons bunker coal was also sold at Brooketon, of which 250 tons was taken by the s. s. Josefina, which arrived here on the 8th from Manila.
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, MAY 1. 1920.
109
Coal in stock at the end of the month amounted to 1.419-75 tons.
Two of the out-crop workings were closed down towards the end of the month, the coal in these places having been worked out, and two others were temporarily sealed off, owing to fires caused by spontaneous combustion in the broken pillars. This will effect our out-put for April, but with new places starting to produce coal towards the end of the new month, we hope soon to get back to our normal out-put.
Everything ran smoothly in the mechanical department. Two boilers were cleaned and all-machinery overhauled at the beginning of the month.
The coal sales at Labuan amounted to 470 tons, 417 tons of this was taken by Messrs, the Straits Steamship Company's steamers and the balance by local launches.
The s. l. L'Aubaine was under repairs to her boiler from the 17th. to the 20th. inclusive. An old patch, which had been causing a great deal of trouble, was taken off and a new one put on.
Re-timbering of the Bhang Tawar oil level was done throughout the month. We have about 1,250 gallon. Barembang oil in stock at present. The rainfall at Brooketon Mines was 377 inches only.
