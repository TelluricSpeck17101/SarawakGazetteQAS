NOTES.
(February.)
H. H. S. Y. Zahora sailed on the 15th for Sibil and the North. Passengers to Sibu were the Honble. Mr. J. Baring-Gould, Mother Sebastian and Mother Alphonsa.
ACTING on instructions from Her Highness the Ranee, a general meeting was held at the Ranees Club house on Monday, February 16th to wind up the affairs of the Ranees Club. It is hoped that this will in future become a Subscription Club, run on the ordinary lines of such institutions.
ON the 17th the s.s. Kuching left for Singapore. Messrs. Hatton Hall and B. V. Seaward were passengers.
ON Friday last, the 20th, the third of the small after dinner dances was given at the building known until 3 days ago as the Ranees Club.
Although the idea of having these dances is by no means new, it has required the right moving spirit to bring them about and now that they have been successfully launched it is hoped they will become a permanent feature.
Perhaps it is not out of place to mention that these dances afford an excellent opportunity for non-dancing men to take the floor. One or two who gained courage as the evening wore on and danced appeared to enjoy it immensely; at least we hope so.
Our best thanks are due to the organisers for a thoroughly enjoyable evening.(Contributed.)

THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, MARCH 1, 1920.
DURING a game of billiards at the Sarawak Club on the 22nd the second break exceeding 100 which has been scored there was made by Mr. J. M. Bryan who compiled 105. It was the same player who first passed the hundred on the Club tables by making a break of 101 not many months ago.
To celebrate the birthday of Her Highness the Ranee on the 24th a salute of 21 guns was fired from Fort Margherita and all Government offices were closed.
A number of people foregathered in the Residency between 10 and 12 a.m. to wish Her Highness many happy returns of the day.
A dinner was also given at the Astana that evening.
Ma. Lang has kindly consented to take over the duties of Hon. Secretary to the Golf Club during the absence of Mr. Ermen on leave.
A consignment of new rifles and a Lewis gun have lately arrived in Kuching for the use of the Sarawak Rangers. On the 23rd the Lewis gun went through a very satisfactory test on the range, where it was tried at a target representing human figures. His Highness the Rajah, his A. D. C. Capt. W. R. B. Gifford and the Superintendent of Police all fired short bursts and the Commandant of the Sarawak Rangers with Lieutenant Clark were also present. A light gun of this sort, which can be easily carried about by one man, should be extremely useful in the irregular jungle fighting which sometimes occurs on expeditions against refractory Dayaks who have disturbed the peace of the country.
Miri Notes.
?
The weather having changed at last, lawn tennis on the grass court has become popular again and is once more the popular turn. A tournament is to come off shortly it is understood.
The s. s. Kajang. after she hud run on a reef near Kudat aud various contrary reports had arrived about her, turned up at 8 p. m. on January 31st. As there were a number of passengers from Miri to go by her, among them Major Benjamin and Mr. and Mrs. Bromfield, the latter of whom are leaving for good, there was a great rush to get out, which was added to by two of the launches breaking down, so the Helen had to do all the work. The Kajang also took down a large consignment of rubber, damar and jelutong from Miri and Baram as a trial cargo. She sailed at 1 a.m.
It is reported that she was badly holed by the coral reef and that her forward hold was full of water.
On Saturday evening February 7th a very enjoyable little entertainment was given in the Miri Club by the Miri Amateur Dramatic Society. The main feature of the evening was a spirited farce in one act entitled The Area Belle, this rather unusually attractive domestic being portrayed in a vivacious manner by Mrs. Douglas. How she extricated herself from an embarrassing situation when her two admirers and rivals, P. C. Pitcher (Mr. Kittson Thomas) and Pte. Tosser (Rouble. R. s. Douglas), arrived
simultaneously, further complicated by the unexpected return of her slightly vinegarish and passed widowed mistressthis latter difficult character being nobly filled by Dr. Foster Smithis a matter of joyous recollection for those who were present, and evoked roars of laughter. However it having been proved most conclusively that Tosser and Pitcher, after the manner of their kind, only came for creature comforts in the shape of cold mutton and beer, Cupid in the guise of the milkman, Farmer Chalks, (Mr. Kort right) came into his own, and the curtain came down amid ringing applause.
The second half of the concert consisted mainly of musical numbers and a charade, the solution of which was Children", and the babes in this latter not being of that airy lightness of which dreams are made, very properly caused considerable amusement. Many old and new favourites were included among the songs, Mrs. Crommelin by her rendering of soldiers ditties particularly elicited enthusiastic support from the male portion of her audience. The singing of God save the Rajah" followed by the National Anthem wound up a very jolly three hours performance at mid-night.
The programme was as follows:

Indian Dairying.
(Extract from a New Zealand paper.)
According to a bulletin issued by the Department of Agriculture of the Bombay Presidency, one pound of cream (approximately) is obtained from 6 to 8lb of buffalo's milk, and from 10 to 121b of cow's milk, and one pound of butter is obtained from 12 to 141b of buffalos milk and from 20 to 241b of cow's milk. This standard, however, is found to vary month by month. According to Indian processes, 15 to 181b of buffalo's milk is required to produce one pound of home-made buffalo butter, containing 17.45 per cent, moisture, 81.60 per cent, fat, 0 86 per cent, casein, and 0.03 per cent. ash. This butter yields about 80 per cent, of ghee, or clarified butter, obtained by evaporating the water by boiling it on a low tire for about 30 minutes; ghee from fresh buffalo butter can be kept for about two or three months without deterioration.

I wonder why the men and girls foregathere
I wonder how the Ladies' Club is run?

I wonder why the ladies aren't admitted
Into the precincts of the Die-hard's den
And why sometimes they can't play bridge together Or tennis at the Men's Club with the men?

I wonder why the price of rice is rising
And why we can't take steps to plant out more
And why the cost of living is expensive
And why the dollar sticks at two and four?

CORRESPONDENCE

February 24th, 1920.
The Editor,	Sarawak Gazette.
DEAR SIR,
The following is a fair specimen of profiteering in Eastern goods in England.
A lady in Singapore recently purchased a small doll's tea set of Japanese manufacture to send to a child at home for the sum of 40 cents (about lid.). She took it home, and shortly after arrival saw, an absolutely identical set in a London toy shop priced at 5/6d. The small celluloid toys we could purchase in the local shops for a few cents sold at l/6d. each at home. The freight on a case of such toys could not surely account for the rise in price of each article.
The local trader is rapidly raising the prices of home made goods though the home prices may not be rising. Can we blame him when our own people set such a good example?
The Chinese will copy anythingincluding our
methodsHe is doing it.
I am, dear Sir.
Yours faithfully.
CUSTOMER.
A Question of Etiquette?
The Editor,
Sarawak Gazette.
DEAR SIR.
Can you put me right on a matter of etiquette? If I call on people, should they return my call or acknowledge it in any way? If they do not, am I to presume that they do not desire any further acquaintance with me?
Of course it may be that some people are too busy
playing tennis, golf or bridge to take any notice of calls; or it may lie that they consider all calling is tommy-rot", but in this case would it not be better to find means to notify this fact and so save others the pleasure (?) of putting on store clothes" and spending a hot afternoon in calling on those who hold these views.
If the presumption that these people do not want to know me is incorrect perhaps my letter should be headed A Question of Manners".
Yours, etc.,
PERPLEXED.

Court.There has been less Court work during the month than usual; the following being the only cases worthy of mention.
Manau, a Malay trader hawking in the left hand Branch, was fined $100 for selling rice above the controlled rates. Abun was fined $50 for abducting the daughter of Bija.
Kotong a Singghi Dayak set a number of tukaks in a path leading to his fruit trees at Singghi and seriously injured another Dayak by doing so. Complaints of the
60 THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, MARCH 1, 1920.
plaints of the depredations of Javanese coolies from the Sungei Tengah Estate are numerous and Kotong set the tukaks to protect his fruit and sirih from them.
Pu Poi was fined $25 for attempting to bribe the police and the following were sent to gaol for theft Kong Cheong, Jong Mee, Pui Jan and Bong Jit.
Jong Siuk was sentenced to twenty months R. I. for causing grievous hurt to a Javanese named Sengari at Musi with a parang. The affair look place some months ago and the offender escaped but was I smartly captured by P. C. Seman of Buso who recognised him coming off to the launch at Sejijak and arrested him on board.
P. C. Talip for causing a disturbance in the bazaar while under the influence of drink was sentenced to fourteen days imprisonment and returned to headquarters.
Comparatively few claims were dealt with in the Court of Requests.
Public Works.The heavy rain during the month causeri several land slips along some of the roads. A large one on the Buan road took the whole prison gang several days to remove and a further slide will certainly take place if there is any more heavy rain. A second fall was removed by contract. The gang completed the raising of the road from the Court to near Bau Club in spite of the weather which handicapped them considerably.
A number of the prisoners have been suffering from influenza colds due to the incessant rain to which they are constantly exposed.
A new 3" pipe-line has been laid from the Company's water main at the Works to the Court and branches put in to barracks, gaol, etc. This replaces the old pipe which was quite rotten and carried but little water. It branched from the bazaar main and consequently affected the bazaar supply, but as the new line leads direct from the main a better supply of water is obtained at both Court and bazaar.
The site for the new clerk's house has been levelled the timber is ready and construction begins next month.
The 60 foot bridge across S. Kradain below Siniawan was completely demolished by a large engkabang tree falling across it. The Public Works have been communicated with and a new bridge will be built as soon as possible.
General.Lim Kim Han arrived from Kuching on the 2nd to take over the duties of the late Ah Nyuk (deceased) Court Writer.
An unfortunate accident occurred at the mine on the 10th a Chinese named Ah Wan being killed while at work repairing one of the electric cables in Tai Parit. The current had been cut off and several men were at work on the post when the circuit was suddenly closed at the power house and Ah Wan, who happened to Ire touching the cable, received a shock which knocked him off the post and he fell, his head striking an iron pipe on the ground. Death ensued shortly after.
At the enquiry it transpired that the boy at the switchboard had either misunderstood an order given or had, in error, closed the wrong circuit. It was suggested that older and more reliable persons should be employed on the switchboard in future and the boy was dismissed by the Company.
Bishop Danson paid a short visit to Bau on the 13th returning to Kuching on the 15th. His intended visit to Dahan did not take place owing to the flooded state of the country at the time.
I went to Kuching on the 19th returning next day. A gang robbery occurred at Pengkallan Singghi on the night of the 23rd when five masked Chinese entered Bong Kang's house and after securing him
cleared the place of everything of value including rice, rubber and $20 in notes.
Mr. Mead, Conservator of Forests, with Mrs. Mead arrived from Kuching on the 30th.
The new Forest Clearing Station was put in hand by the contractor before the end of the month.
The rainfall totalled 29'96". This included one or two heavy falls and the river rose considerably, flooding some of the surrounding country, but not high enough to cause damage to gardens as has been the case in former years.
There has been a deal of sickness throughout the districtapparently a form of influenza, but it was at no time serious.
The Dayak padi crop promises well, and if conditions continue favourable the harvest will be a record one. In some parts of the district the padi is already being harvested in small quantities and the Dayaks are now fully alive to the importance of not wasting a single grain. Although they were given fair warning of the impending shortage of rice they still put their faith in the bazaar supplies which had never failed them yet, and this faith has now been rudely shaken.
A heavy crop of illipe nuts is now ripening and traders are making the necessary arrangements for their collection by the Dayaks. Unfortunately the crop will ripen at the same time as the padi, and although good prices are promised I do not think the Dayaks will worry about their collection if doing so is likely to interfere with their harvesting operations.
The out-put of the Cyaniding Works amounted to gold 1,049.3 ozs. and silver 199.4 ozs.
Dahah Estate harvested 14,200 lbs. of dry rubber during January.

January, 1920.
Once a day from the 5th until the 11th the station, wharf and adjacent land was flooded.
The tides on the 5th were said to be the highest ever known here, but on the 6th were again higher. The wharf and yards were entirely inundated, and only by great good luck and some hard work was the rice saved from a wetting.
On the 5th raised platforms were erected in the godown and the water came up to the planks, so next day the rice was again moved and higher platforms built.
Mr. Evans tells me he has never before known the water to enter the godown : but on the 6th there were over two feet of waler in it.
Great damage was done to the paths, and on the 7th at about of a mile from the wharf, the engine coming from the mine was obliged to stop, as the water was damping the fires.
On the 10th P. C. Bakar arrived from Tebekang bringing two Chinese, who were said to have assaulted and caused the death of another. Chinese at that place.
After hearing the preliminaries of the enquiry here, I left for Tebekang on the early morning of the 13th and arrived there on the evening of the 15th.
A full report of the affair, which resulted in the death of one Jong Ah Cheh, has been forwarded to His Highness the Rajah.
The policeman who was stationed at Tebekang last year, and who was supposed to mow the grass and look after the bungalow and grounds, had obviously done nothing at all, since I last visited there in November. The
THE SARAWAK GAZETTE, MARCH 1, 1920.

bungalow was in a filthy stale, birds and bats having used it to roost in. Tebekang is only visited once or twice a year, and the idea of keeping a policeman there and expecting him to do anything, so far away from supervision is futile.
Having received permission from the Honble, the Resident, I went on from Tebekang to Balai Karangan on the chance of meeting the Controleur of Sanggan to arrange with him for the taking over of the murderers of Ong Cheng, who was killed and robbed near here last June, the murderers escaping over the border; but who I heard had been arrested by the Dutch authorities.
I did not meet the Controleur however who was, I learned, travelling in another part of his district.
We walked to Balai Karangan from Krosen, passing and calling at the Dayak villages of Piau, Sabinting, Lobong Batu, Duka, Mapau and Bantan which is in Dutch territory: and returning took another way. repassing Bantan and Mapau, and coming to Terebat in the ulu Gedop. From there passing Mentu, Tapu, Mentong, Meringgo, Bedup and crossing the ulu Gedong where it becomes the Malikin entered the Bari river: and after proceeding up this for some distance, walked across to Penghulu Ali's house. From there we walked to the Staban river and going down this, came out in the ulu Simunjan at Ah Boh's house. Leaving there and going down the Simunjan river to Melanjok, we walked across and came out on the 28th at the Sadong coal mines.
During this walk I saw hundreds of acres of hill padi farms, which, with few exceptions, were looking splendid.
The Dayaks at Tebekang and Pichin had a near escape early in the month from having their low land padi ruined by floods, which however receded just in time.
The padi on the banks of the main river and the Simunjan river looked good.
Many people have expressed their desire to sell their surplus padi to Government, and I have had the honour to ask the permission of His Highness the Rajah to build a suitable godown, in which to store it. This would be far more satisfactory than allowing the Chinese to obtain the padi for raiding purposes as heretofore.

SADONG COLLIERY.
January.
The gross out-put from the mines during the month was l,448 tons, 465 tons of this was consumed by the Colliery and 983 tons delivered for export.
The shipments for the month were, viz: The Kuching Municipality ...	... 277.09 tons.
Messrs. The Borneo Company, Ltd.	... 108.00 ,,

,, British Malaysian Manfg. Co. 93.03 ,,
Total 781.18 tons.
The balance of stock on the wharf at the end of the month was 420.18 tons.
Good drivage was obtained in the new Deep around the fall in No. 8 mine and a connection should be holed through to the old Deep on the
lower side within a week's time, sufficiently big for carrying air through to ventilate the workings of No. 9 mine.
The mines in the upper seam produced well up to within a few days of the end of the month, when a denudation, cutting out the coal seam- completely at right angles to the face-line, was struck.
One new belian coolie line was completed, also a new house for the storekeeper and the work on the new store was commenced.
Everything went well in the mechanical department. There was rather more than the usual number of mild fever cases, which caused a good deal of absence from work, while the labour shortage for the underground is being increasingly felt.
The rainfall for the month was 31'96 inches.

SIMANGGANG
?
December, 1919.
The fruit season commenced early in the month, and over one hundred boats arrived from the Kalaka, Saribas, Sabuyow and Lingga with whole families intent on seeking fruit.
During the month there was scarcely a Malay left in the kampongs, the whole populace being engaged in making durian preserves in the Batang Ayer and the Skrang. Fruit was very plentiful, and durians were sold for 300 a dollar.
The scarcity of rice was left during the month, and there were numerous appeals for Government assistance.
On the 6th I took passage by the s. 1. Hong Line for Engklili and next morning held Court. During the afternoon I visited a number of Chinese, Dayak and Malay pepper gardens and found them kept in excellent order. Dayaks have seriously taken to planting pepper and nave made big profits. The bazaar at Engklili will be erected after Chinese New Year, and will be a great advantage to every one. A Native Oflicer will shortly be appointed us the population is on the increase. Both Chinese and Dayaks do their best to evade paying timber royalty, etc.
The Court was mostly occupied in settling durian fruit tree disputes and jelutong boundaries. Ptes. Nyalau and Akep were sentenced to one year R. I. each for theft of Government rice from the fort.
Penghulu Apai Karna of Engkari paid a visit to Simanggang and made various complaints; the chief being that the Ulu Ai Dayaks were not inclined to go to Miri to work as coolies, as his people and others had been swindled by a Malay mandor there who took some $400 in notes saying he would exchange them for dollars, and absconded instead of doing this.
Draup and Tuanku Ali have been busy during the month examining into the working of timber by Chinese and Dayaks, who require wood for their pepper gardens.
The 25th being Christmas Day the offices were closed.
On the 27th I left for Kuching by boat to attend the Sarawak Regatta.
Saribas.The estates of three wealthy Dayaks of Seruai were valued and the usual probate fees imposed.
Abang Embit, Native Officer, Spaoh reports that there is a great deal of petty thriving going on, Malays are suspected. One young Malay of about 15 years of age was caught stealing from a Chinaman's shop and sent to Simanggang for sentence.

Chua Ma Teng was fined for breach of rice regulations also Haji Aim for same offence.
At Saratok from 1st to 15th hundreds of Malays and Dayaks as well as Chinese came to the Court house asking Government assistance to obtain rice, there being none in the bazaar. P. C. Bujang was sent up-river to see if he could buy padi, he was only able to obtain a few pasus.
The herd of cattle number 57 head and are in excellent condition.
The Kabong and Roban spirit and gambling farms were taken over by Chop Hak Lee for three years at a rental of $57 per mensem, an increase of $10.

On the 6th I returned from Kuching and on arrival at Simanggang Mr. W. F. Dick reported all well during my absence.
There was much rain during the early part of the month and heavy floods were experienced. This was reported to be the highest flood ever known at Simanggang. Padi farms in lower Skrang and near Sada in the main river were submerged for five days and a deal of damage done to the padi.
The unclemency of the weather during the past few months has precluded any extensive repairs to roads and it is useless attempting anything until the fine weather sets in.
The Court was mostly occupied in hearing and settling Jelutong road disputes, and a number of natives were fined for working roads without permits. Penghulu Labang of Skrang was fined one picul for slackness in connection with the murder of one Naieng. Bujang and Drahman of Pusa four months each for theft of jelutong. Ah Lek of Debak six months for non-payment of fine imposed in re breach of rice regulations. Mahtar fined $100 for abducting a young Malay girl.
Draup of the Land Office left for the Sebuyow district towards the middle of the month to examine into Jelutong road disputes, and was still away at end of the month.
Mr. J. A. H. Hardie, Resident 2nd Class, returned from furlough to the station on the 14th.
On the 18th Penghulus Embuas and Kama and party arrived from Lubok Antu and on 20th proceeded to Sibu via Kuching to attend the trial of certain Bintulu Dayaks, who have murdered relations of Ulu Ai Dayaks in the Bintulu.
Saribas.There was a good demand from Paku Dayaks for permits to open up sago plantations. The Paku Dayaks are very wealthy and industrious. They nearly all have para plantations which are tappable and with the proceeds intend to fell large stretches of jungle for planting sago.
Penghulu Jabieng of the Padih paid in fines imposed by him amounting to $440.96, and he received the usual commissions.
Dayaks have started harvesting their hill padi and report they expect a record crop.
Kalaka.A number of natives were before the Saratok Court for working jelutong without a license and also for breach of sago regulation. The offenders were duly fined.
The ketio trees are in fruit, but natives are unable to collect the same, as they are busy harvesting.
At the beginning of the month there was an unusually big flood, which did much damage to roads and bridges, etc.
Abang Bujang N. O Kalaka reports that he held full enquiry concerning one Chuli who shot and wounded one Maraji of S'blak. It appears that Chuli, Maraji and others were quarrelling when they came to blows, so Chuli picked up his gun and fired at the crowd who were assaulting each other and thereby wounded Maraji. The Dayaks concerned will come before the Simanggang Court are long.
The following are the trade returns for the division, viz:
January.
The island of Sibu was under water, during the greater part of the month. These floods were the first that have been experienced during the N E. monsoon. Fortunately no damage was done to the padi farms.
I visited some of the Foo Chow farms which look exceptionally well. The Foo Chows reckon that they will harvest some 20,000 piculs should the crops not be attacked by mice. This amount, however, is not sufficient to supply the whole Foo Chow community.
The Dayak and Malay farms have been damaged by pig, but not to any serious extent.
There was a great shortage of rice during the greater part of the month. A small consignment of inferior parboiled rice, arrived per the s. s. Flevo, after this was finished no rice was procurable until the arrival of the s. s. Gladys, on the 28th. Fortunately there were sufficient stocks of flour in the bazaar to feed the people.
Messrs. Carpenter, Cotterill and Horton arrived per the s.s. Alice Lorraine, on the 14th. Messrs. Carpenter and Cotterill were appointed to do duly at Sibu and Mr. Horton to do duty at Mukah, to which station he proceeded on the following day, via the Cut.
Mr. W. R. T. Clement was on duty in the Matti district from the 3rd to the 18th.
Mr. G. M. Gifford left for Kuching, per the s. s. Alice Lorraine, on the 20th; and was still away at the end of the month. The Revd. Father Stotter proceeded to Kuching by the same steamer.
I am given to understand that the Revd. Father is not expected to return to the Dalat Mission as he has been appointed to Jesselton.
A petition was received from the Sarikei Chinese in which they accused the Court Writer of various unlawful sets. An enquiry was held but nothing unlawful was proved against the Court Writer. The cause of the trouble was the shortage of rice, the Chinese appearing to object to the necessary restrictions.
The shortage of house accomodation in the Sibu bazaar is causing great inconvenience. The rentals are being raised every month and in case of a tenant not being able at once to meet the increased rental, he is promptly evicted, and is unable to find another residence. This state of affairs should be considerably relieved when the twenty-five houses have been built on the new allotments.
A Skapa'an, named Tama Lassah, is reported to have been drowned in the Langraran rapids.

January.
Many cases came before the Courts for hearing but none of any importance, being mostly for breach of fanning regulations.
Fines and fees amounted to $787.
There was a penyamun scare in the Apoh and Tutau at the end of last month; a letter was sent warning the people they would be heavily fined if any more was heard.
It is now reported that Penghulu Aban Blaweng (Tama Saging) started the rumours informing his people that Data Sheriff Hamid had told him that Government was sending a penyamun of Sikhs up-river in the launch and that if they killed any of them they would find $100 on each in notes.
I have sent for all chiefs and principal people concerned, when investigation will be made.
There was also a small scare in the kanipong amongst the Malays, but owing to prompt measures being taken by Native Officer Tuanku Drahman, the affair quickly died out.
Penghulus Lanting, Rhu and Aban Blaweng paid one visit each but had nothing of importance to report.
Mr. Audreini inspected the telephone line as far as Purau and the reports track in a very bad state. This will be cleared by Bakong Dayaks after harvest.
Towkay Kiat Seng cleared for Miri with about $40,000 worth of jungle produce, which he shipping direct to Singapore.
Tuanku Drahman. Native Officer, left by s. 1. La Follette for up-river to obtain padi and rice from Kayans and was still away at end of month.
I informed the Government servants that owing to the padi now being ripe and the supply of rice obtained from the Food Controller being finished, there will be no more rice store account after the month of February.
The rainfall was 1803 inches.
Prisoners were engaged on repairing bridges on Limbang road and in ornamental grounds.

Owing to a great increase of water in the mines, caused by heavy rains, the pump in the West Slant could not quite cope with the amount of water making, and consequently had to be raised some distance up the Deep. Owing to the proximity of the North Slant to the old workings of the West Slant and the danger of the water breaking through, work in the first named Deep has been suspended until we are able to lower the pump in the latter again. This we hope to be able to do very soon.
The usual work of cleaning boilers and overhauling machinery was done at the beginning of the month.
The s. 1. LAubaine was lying at Brooketon from the 9th to mid-day of the 14th having her boiler cleaned and engines overhauled.
The No. 1 lighter which was beached in the middle of December was still under repairs at the end of the month.
Messrs. J. Hatton Hull and Mungo Park arrived here on the evening of the 5th. The latter gentleman came to inspect the mines with a view to making a report on same for Mr. Hatton Hall. Every assistance was given to Mr. Park while inspecting the mines, and all plans of the Collieries were put at his disposal. Coal sales at Labuan amounted to 1,089 tons made up as follows:
